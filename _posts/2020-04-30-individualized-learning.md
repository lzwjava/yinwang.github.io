title: "One-on-one teaching plan"
---


(Update: The duration of one-on-one teaching was originally set to be no more than two months. Due to actual circumstances, I have adjusted it to be no more than three months. )

(Update: Due to the time and energy required for one-on-one teaching, and the monotony of repeating lessons for teachers, I have decided to reduce the number of one-on-one teaching sessions and adjust the price to 18000. This will also give students more selectivity. I hope everyone understands this change and welcome everyone to actively sign up for group courses. )

We have been conducting the computer science fundamental course for two weeks now, and I can finally believe that the initial goal of "zero foundation education" is a good starting point. Not only does it allow me to test and improve my knowledge and teaching methods, but it seems that people with no foundation are easier to teach correct and clean knowledge.

The members of this period's course come from various backgrounds. Some students have no science background and have not attended university, some are purely out of interest, and some have already graduated with a PhD several years ago. Their performance, thinking angles and depth, and learning attitudes and motivation in the past two weeks have surprised and pleased me. Every time I see their progress, I feel it is all worth it. I am changing people's lives. I have found that the content and method of my teaching differ significantly from that of the school's computer education. Based on student feedback, I try to find better ways of doing things. I discovered that people who know nothing about computers are more likely to understand the essence of ideas and more willing to open their minds and try, without producing doubts, arrogance, anxiety, or resistance emotions. Just like a clean new computer with no outdated content cluttering it, it is easier to install new systems. In my class, ignorance can be a blessing.

Recently, I have been experimenting with a new teaching method, which is completely one-on-one teaching. The results in small classes have been quite good. Each student has private messaging communication with me during the course, and they receive a lot of personalized feedback after class. Each student has different levels of understanding depth, different homework progress, and different mistakes. I provide different feedback for each student.

Some students are shy and hesitant to speak up in class, fearing that others may laugh at them or think they are less intelligent. I cannot control these psychological phenomena, which slightly hindered the implementation of the "Socratic" teaching I had envisioned. However, even with its minor flaws, this teaching method is much stronger than the computer basics education in universities, not only in terms of content but also in terms of methods and approaches.

Of course, regular classes are still welcome for everyone to enroll, but I also accept a limited number of one-on-one students. In fact, I already have a few of these students, and the results have been excellent. Now I will describe this new approach:

1. No fixed class time. The course is mainly conducted through WeChat messages, allowing for genuine "Socratic dialogue." I gradually propose some questions, and students answer. For concepts that are difficult to explain, we may also use short-term Zoom meeting methods. However, for effective questioning, it is necessary to have a certain period of continuous interaction, rather than a message that is spaced out over many hours. 2. Due to the flexibility of WeChat messages, this teaching is transnational, transcultural, and very flexible. You can even receive a little teaching after having tea. My messages include beneficial questions and tips, allowing students to think for a while before replying. There's no one watching or waiting for you, reducing pressure and facilitating free thinking.

3. Since most knowledge is acquired by students through answering questions and independent thinking, this type of knowledge may be more reliable and easier to apply than knowledge transferred in traditional classroom settings.

4. The content scope is the same as that of a regular class, but the teaching method is different. Please clarify your expectations, understanding that "one-on-one teaching" does not mean I will teach you exactly what you want to know. The content is pre-planned, but the one-on-one format allows for adjustments based on your personal time and response to effectively help you learn these concepts. Experienced individuals should not use this "beginner's course" to gain information beyond the scope, to avoid disappointment.

5. There is no specified textbook for the course, and teaching will not be based on any one book. Pre-reading certain books (such as SICP) will not benefit the teaching. Quite the opposite, delving into other content and getting deeply engrossed might have an adverse effect and mislead the teaching. I'd rather not spend too much effort explaining confusion caused by prior knowledge. The best approach is to try and forget everything beforehand.

6. The start time is flexible, and the duration is within 3 months. If you progress quickly, you might finish early and have learned successfully. If you are slow, you will still finish within 2 months. This is to prevent those who don't put in effort from dragging out the process indefinitely. 1. This class values practice and is not suitable for those unwilling to think and work. Do not assume lying there and casually speaking will make you proficient. Just like working out, you cannot lie there idle to build muscles. You need to follow my guidance, give your mind a systematic exercise, making it strong and precise. Self-thinking and self-doing are necessary, and the practice will be extensive. I will demand specific, exact, runnable, elegant code from you. I will set high standards and require corrections for any imperfections. You will produce code of art level. I dislike those who do not put in effort, will not answer unconsidered questions, or execute untested code, or repeat the same points.

2. One-on-one teaching fee is 18000 (new price).

Since each student is taught individually, capacity will be limited. Given my familiarity with these contents and the minimal pressure on me personally, I am confident in using this method to cultivate more advanced technical workers and computer scientists from scratch.

Please note, this one-on-one teaching still falls under "zero-foundation teaching," and it is not suitable for experienced engineers. Since I have predefined content boundaries, if you have already learned much of the content, it may be a waste of our time. If you understand what I say, there will be little room for question and answer.

Interested parties may apply using the same registration method for regular courses, please specify "Application for One-on-One Teaching" in your application. Please consider carefully, trust me enough, and decide to join before contacting me. I do not have the time or energy to address various concerns or persuade anyone to join. Do not register and negotiate prices or request installment payments, wasting everyone's time. I. The Great Wall of China
The Great Wall of China, a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against raids and invasions from various nomadic groups.

II. History
The construction of the Great Wall began as early as the 7th century BC with various Chinese states building walls for their own defense. The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, ordered the construction of a wall to protect his newly unified empire from the Xiongnu in 221 BC. Over the centuries, the wall was built, rebuilt, and expanded by various Chinese dynasties. The most famous and extensive sections were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

III. Length and Height
The total length of the Great Wall is estimated to be around 21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles), making it the longest wall in the world. The average height of the wall is about 7.5 meters (24.6 feet), but it can reach up to 15 meters (49.2 feet) in some areas.

IV. Materials
The Great Wall was built using a variety of materials, including rammed earth, tamped earth, wood, brick, and stone. The most famous sections of the wall, however, were built using large quantities of brick and stone.

V. Structure
The Great Wall is not a continuous wall, but rather a series of walls and fortifications built along the historical northern borders of China. The wall is made up of several sections, each with its own unique characteristics and building techniques. Some sections are made of rammed earth or tamped earth, while others are made of brick or stone. The wall also includes watchtowers, fortresses, and other defensive structures.

VI. Cultural Significance
The Great Wall of China is a symbol of Chinese civilization and a source of national pride. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist destination. The wall represents the strength and resilience of the Chinese people and their ability to defend their territory against external threats. It is also a reminder of the rich history and cultural heritage of China.

VII. Conservation and Restoration
The Great Wall of China is a massive and complex structure that requires constant conservation and restoration efforts. The wall is exposed to the elements and is subject to degradation and damage from weather, erosion, and human activity. The Chinese government and various organizations have undertaken extensive conservation and restoration projects to preserve the wall and make it accessible to visitors.

VIII. Visiting the Great Wall
Visiting the Great Wall of China is a must-do experience for many travelers. There are several popular sections of the wall that are easily accessible from Beijing, including Badaling, Mutianyu, and Simatai. Visitors can hike along the wall, explore the watchtowers and fortresses, and take in the breathtaking views of the surrounding countryside. It is recommended to visit the wall during the spring or autumn months for the best weather and scenery.
