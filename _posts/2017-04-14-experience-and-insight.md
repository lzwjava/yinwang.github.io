title: "Extensive Experience and Insight"
---


Many people value "experience," such as those who claim to have 30 years of experience in a certain field and use specific techniques. I believe experience is valuable, and I have experience in various fields. However, I don't put experience in a very important position because I possess something that most people lack and overlook: insight.

Every time I enter a new company, I enter different domains. At the beginning, I might know very little about that domain. Some people even think I have no experience and can "educate" me. However, they never imagined that I quickly grasped their experience and, through distillation, discarded the garbage, quickly surpassing them and achieving goals they couldn't reach. This is the power of insight.

For example, many people have experience with threads, but how many people truly understand the essence of threads? How many people have a mental image of the various dynamic features of multithreaded programs? In reality, very few people know this. This is why many people excessively use thread concurrency, resulting in various synchronization issues, race conditions, and deadlocks. A piece of multithreaded code from a company was touted as being "written by programmers with a lot of concurrent programming experience." I found subtle competition situations in it not long after, which caused serious consequences after a few days. The programmers with a lot of concurrent programming experience didn't notice this competition situation for two years, while I, who wrote fewer multithreaded programs, not only found this competition but quickly came up with a solution, which was why? It was due to insight. I knew the essence of threads, which experience wouldn't tell you.

What is insight? Insight is the ability to see through phenomena to their essence. People with insight easily gain experience, while those with experience may not necessarily have insight. Even the most simple-minded people can acquire experience through extensive time, but it is difficult to obtain insight no matter how much time and energy you invest. Therefore, insight is much more valuable than experience. It's hard to explain clearly how to have insight, and few people will tell you how to obtain it. Of course, I won't tell you either. I often look at others' resumes and list various technical experiences I am familiar with. Due to this reason, I have removed all my past work experiences from my Linkedin. These things listed there diminish my value to myself. I am a label-free, uncategorizable person, truly valuable.

Experience may not be the most important thing, but it is necessary. Many technologies you cannot completely avoid, but once you touch them, you understand. However, without real problems, you have no motivation to approach those technologies. So I have been doing one thing, which is to touch various technologies and gain more experience through insight. After returning home, I planned to make my own product. At the same time, I intended to cooperate with domestic companies or individuals in this regard. I use insight to help solve their most challenging, unsolvable problems, thus gaining experience. Of course, I am not an employee of the company, but an independent consultant. I symbolically charge a fee from the company, in other words, acting as a "career assassin." For individuals, their problems must be inspiring to me. Interested companies or individuals can contact me.
