title: "Why is the cello so hard to learn?"
---


A month ago, I decided to start learning the cello, found a teacher and attended several classes, and watched many cello teaching videos on YouTube every day, pondering and practicing. Then I found out that the cello was actually one of the hardest instruments to learn in the world. Not only is the instrument itself difficult, but the teaching methods also pose a problem.

Reflecting on the reasons, I feel that it's worth recording and sharing with those interested in education. If you are a cello or violin performer or student, this article might contain something useful that no teacher would tell you about the secrets behind this type of instrument.

### The teaching methods of robots

The teaching methods for the cello are similar to those for sports like tennis. First, let's talk about the cello. The cello is a large and complex instrument. It has a long neck, a large body, and four strings. The strings are made of different materials, and the bow is also made of different materials. The cello's size and complexity make it difficult for beginners to hold and play.

Moreover, the cello's sound quality is affected by various factors such as the humidity and temperature of the environment, the tension of the strings, and the position of the bridge. These factors make it challenging for beginners to produce a good sound.

The cello's teaching methods are also problematic. Unlike other instruments like the piano or the guitar, which have clear and definite notes, the cello's notes are not so clear-cut. The cello's notes depend on the position of the fingers on the fingerboard and the pressure applied to the strings. This makes it difficult for beginners to learn the correct finger positions and bowing techniques.

Furthermore, the cello's teaching methods are often based on rote learning, which means memorizing pieces without fully understanding the underlying musical concepts. This approach can lead to poor technique and a lack of musicality.

In contrast, sports like tennis have clear and objective rules, and the results of the game are easily measurable. The teaching methods for tennis are based on a systematic approach, which helps players understand the fundamental principles of the game and develop good technique.

To improve the teaching methods for the cello, we need to adopt a more systematic and scientific approach. This could involve using technology to help students learn the correct finger positions and bowing techniques, and providing more opportunities for students to practice playing in different environments to help them develop the ability to adapt to various playing conditions.

In conclusion, learning the cello is a challenging but rewarding experience. While the instrument itself is complex and difficult, the teaching methods also pose significant challenges. By adopting a more systematic and scientific approach to teaching the cello, we can help students overcome these challenges and develop the skills they need to become proficient cello players.1. What are the common issues in education of these fields? The problem is that it's overly rigid, treating people like machines for debugging instead of recognizing them as beings with self-regulating abilities. For instance, violin teachers might tell you that this finger should go here, that finger there, what angle this joint should be, the wrist, elbow, and shoulder should move at what times. It seems very scientific and precise, but you can't follow it.

2. If you know how industrial robots are trained before they go into production, you'll find that those are instructions given to the machine, not you.

3. In reality, training industrial robots is probably smarter than how we educate humans. Nowadays, industrial robots already have automatic path planning and obstacle avoidance abilities, and don't need to specify every joint's movement. However, it seems our education system assumes we don't have these basic abilities.

4. It was similar when I took tennis lessons years ago. The teacher specified where every finger on the racket should go, then told me to bend my knees, turn my waist, swing the racket at me, step this way, stop there! Okay, next step... But they didn't tell me what the purpose of these details was.

5. Years later, when I studied Tai Chi, I encountered the same teaching method. I could never remember where the fist should be angled to block at the jawline, only that the teacher kept telling me my hand angle was wrong, but correcting it countless times didn't help because he didn't tell me why the fist had to be at that angle. If he had said "Your angle blocks their fist from coming in," and demonstrated with a few hits, I would have understood, but instead, he just looked at me like a protractor, trying to correct me to his preferred angle. The worst part was that my hand angle was still wrong, and he started correcting my foot angle. When I focused on my foot, my hand angle was wrong again. This is an uncomfortable feeling, and the teaching effect was very poor, to the point that I learned almost nothing and was close to developing a bad habit. Starting with the legendary French cello player...

I don't believe such teaching methods should be conducted in this way. Unfortunately, this teaching style includes not only regular music training teachers, but also some famous cello players. For instance, there's a video on YouTube by the French "legendary" cello player Andre Navarra called "My Cello Technique." I don't know how legendary he is, but after collecting and analyzing information from various sources, I found that he leads people astray in some aspects. For example, he says the little finger should be placed at the "eye" of the bow (the frog), the thumb should be curved, and the tip of the thumb should be placed at an uncomfortable angle. However, many people followed suit and taught others the same way.

I did the same thing at the beginning, and my thumb tip started to hurt at the part called the "frog" (a part used to secure and adjust the bow hair).

It's clear that the frog is designed for securing and adjusting the bow hair, not for gripping. Yet everyone insists on placing the thumb there, and not on the fingertips. The place in front of it is covered with a layer of skin and seems like a good grip area, but they won't let you use it, insisting that you must place your thumb at the most uncomfortable location. They say it will be painful at first, but it will get better once calluses and thick skin develop. However, later I developed calluses and discovered that it wasn't necessary to hold it there at all. I changed my posture, and my thumb naturally found its way to the area with the skin, and now I hold it more steadily and accurately, and the calluses are almost gone.

Do you think the person who designed the cello was stupid? Wrapping a piece of leather in that area but not allowing you to use it, while the actual gripping area doesn't have a comfortable cushion. The cello's designer wasn't stupid, the early users of the cello weren't stupid, but the people who misused these facilities were.1. In the domain of the cello, there are many such counter-intuitive rules. They tell you to do things that you feel should be done differently, making you use an uncomfortable posture. The text below contains several such examples.

2. Some cellists tell you to "relax" your wrist when holding the bow, but can the wrist really relax in this position? With the bow in such a top-heavy position, due to lever effect, the wrist exerts a considerable force. The wrist needs to support the weight of the cello, making it impossible to relax in this situation. In fact, the wrist should not be rigid but rather flexible and agile, but this does not mean it should relax. If you really did relax, the bow would drop. As for why the wrist should be flexible, they don't explain from a theoretical standpoint.

3. In reality, if you watch videos of top cellists (like Pablo Casals), you'll find that many of them don't follow these rules, using various postures. Casals' little finger often isn't on the bow stick, even when it is, it's not in the "eye socket" area. Moreover, his cello is held quite low, which goes against some people's "standard height," saying the cello's corner should be exactly at the height of the knee.

4. Observe other cellists, the little finger doesn't always have to be in the circle. Some might press the little finger on the bow stick, helping to arch the bow stick. Interestingly, no one taught me to put the cello on the strings before I usually pressed the little finger on the bow stick. Later, the little finger might go to another position, I don't know where exactly it went, I only know one thing: the cello bow should move in a certain way. However, there are always people who say, the little finger of the cello should not be placed like that of the violin.

5. Should the right hand thumb be curved?

Note: The text seems to be discussing various unconventional techniques in playing the cello and debunking some common misconceptions. The author emphasizes that top cellists don't necessarily follow these "rules" and encourages flexibility and understanding of the instrument. many people say that the right hand, with the index finger, should be curved at the first joint and not straight. However, if you carefully observe Ma Yufeng's video, his index finger is straight. Upon closer inspection, the index finger is straight and tightly gripping the bow stick, with the muscle controlling the index finger tensed and contracted. Perhaps his index finger is not always extended, but it is not necessarily bent as taught by many.

This video provides a clearer angle.

There is also this video where you can see that the index finger is always extended, steadily pressing against the cello bow. It is clear that the first joint of the index finger is completely "locked" in this position, with the force applied causing the joint to almost flip over.

In this video, you can see that the hand can be held in other positions as well, and Ma Yufeng played out an entire Bach cello suite using this forward position. Interestingly, the bow was still moving as he freely adjusted the grip position. Later, I learned that this grip position is closer to the bow's center of gravity, known as the "Baroque bow-hold" (Baroque bow-grip).

Perhaps due to Pablo Casals' recordings being unrivaled before and after him, Ma Yufeng's performance of Bach cello suite No.1 Prelude was not my favorite, but I cannot deny that his other performances were quite good, and he was an excellent cellist, as well as an inspiring educator. Therefore, his index finger position should be a cause for concern. All people say that the index finger should be curved, so I tried to bend my index finger according to others' opinions, but I always found it unconsciously straightened. I was still puzzled about this. Perhaps because I need to hold a stick steadily, the index finger naturally straightens. Mischa Maisky's bowing posture seems to prove this, as the index finger doesn't necessarily have to be curved. I feel another confusion has been clarified, I just need to follow nature.

Of course, it cannot be said that the index finger must be straight, that would become another dogma. I only say it can be straight, which is not wrong. Not only Mischa Maisky holds the bow like that. Observe other cellists, various postures exist, but I find most people's index fingers are straight.

Besides Andre Navarra, I only found one person whose index finger is always bent, following the posture without fail, that is Mischa Maisky. However, he is not my favorite cello performer.

Regarding whether the index finger should be curved or not, you can refer to other related activities, such as fencing. I found that the use of a cello and a sword is similar, their shapes are similar, they are both a long rod, held in one hand at one end, and require precise and quick movements. If the index finger of a sword is always bent, touching the handle only with the tip of the finger, how would your control over the sword be?

In fact, I found a good way to practice the bowing posture by treating the cello like a sword and practicing swordsmanship for a while. Of course, be careful not to hurt yourself or others in the process. "Should the four fingers of the left hand be curved?"

Similar to the requirement of "bending the index finger," this also applies to the four fingers of the left hand used for fretting on the violin. Many violin teachers tell you that all four fingers of the left hand should be curved into a "bent" shape, not extended and "locked," as shown in the following picture.

However, if you observe the actual posture of violinists, you will find that they often extend and lock these fingers, otherwise some notes cannot be pressed down at the same time. For instance, I once saw a very good violinist who recorded many albums, and he often pressed like this.

Moreover, his left-hand index finger also violated another teaching "do not squeeze," which will be discussed later. Ma Friend's left-hand fingers are often extended, even reversed at the joints, otherwise they cannot apply enough force. For example, the hand in this picture is Ma Friend's hand, and you can see it in this video.

"Bending the four fingers of the left hand" is a teaching rule I followed, but I later found that it made my application of force unstable, and if a finger cannot be extended, it is difficult for one finger to press down two strings at the same time, significantly delaying learning progress. Once this teaching rule is broken, it feels much better, and progress is accelerated. Still another foolish way is to place all four fingers of the left hand simultaneously on the first four notes, with each finger aligned to one note, like this. Some say the thumb should be behind the third finger, while others say it should be aligned with the first finger. In fact, there is no such standard. This alignment relationship does not help at all.

They even want you to be able to drop all four fingers from the sky onto the four notes, and each one must be aligned. However, the human hand is constructed with the index and pinky fingers being very close, making it difficult to separate the four fingers and align them correctly at the same time, as these positions go against the body's construction. Unless you deform your hand joints, it is impossible to do this.

Many teachers, many videos teach this way, but observe Casals and other masters, their fingering is far from this, they rarely press down all four fingers at the same time. In fact, four fingers pressing the same string's four notes is of no use, playing them sequentially is sufficient. Good teachers will tell you not to press unnecessary fingers on the strings.

### Baroque era cello

In fact, in the 18th century Baroque era, the cello was not used as it is now. At that time, the cello did not have the lower stick (endpin), but was propped up between the legs. The bow was also different from the present one, so holding the bow was different, holding it like a knife is good. The cello strings were made of intestines, the sound was softer, and the feel was good. The pitch frequency was 415Hz, which was half a tone lower than the present one. Due to the small string tension, the pressure on the cello was small, and the vibration was very good, pressing the strings was also easy. In this painting, it's Luigi Boccherini, an 18th century Italian composer and cellist. You'll notice the posture of using the cello is quite different from today's, and it has some advantages over modern posture. I tried tucking in the cello's endpin, placing it on my thigh, and using the Baroque cello bow grip. Guess what? The cello's stability increased significantly, and the sound seemed to improve as well. It wasn't as tiring as many people imagine. Plus, lowering the pitch to 415Hz immediately made the tone much better, almost like a new instrument. It felt like the cello took a deep breath and relaxed! I practiced for a while with the 415Hz pitch, and the tone was so beautiful that I didn't want to go back to 440Hz. The LinnStrument software was also adjusted to 415Hz, and after practicing some Bach pieces, I tried 440Hz again, and suddenly it sounded unpleasant. I decided to use 415Hz from now on.

Unfortunately, I heard that domestic music instruments are now generally tuned to 442Hz for "transparency." Is this a cannon or a rocket?

From this picture, you can also see that the cello's neck is not on the shoulder but closer to the side, so his eyes could see the position of his left hand. Although you can get used to it and don't need to look often, occasionally glancing can significantly improve accuracy. Modern cellos are placed on the shoulder, and most positions cannot be seen by the left hand, making it feel like playing blind. I guess this is one reason why the cello is more challenging than other instruments. Small violins, guitars, pianos, double basses, none have this issue.

People often think that old methods are outdated, saying the endpin was invented later, but the old masters could have designed even a simple endpin, right? I believe the endpin's design is for long-term use without getting tired, especially suitable for large orchestras where you need to blend in, but only occasionally move it to assist in performing lengthy symphonies that make people drowsy. In such cases, keeping it on your leg seems redundant, but if you perform Bach's exciting music, you don't need this thing at all.: In the present, a few harpsichordists perform Bach's Cello Suites in a completely authentic manner. For instance, a French harpsichordist named Ophelie Gaillard uses not only Baroque posture but also fully Baroque equipment: a Baroque harpsichord, a Baroque bow, gut strings, and 415Hz tuning. The sound is so beautiful that this album has become one of my favorite harpsichord recordings, alongside Pablo Casals' version.

Check out the historical paintings below for harpsichord postures. Many people hold it under the bow, similar to a violin, which is called the "underhand grip." Historical research shows that about half of the people in that era used this grip. To understand these postures, I bought a Baroque bow and tried this grip, discovering advantages over the "overhand grip" in certain situations, while also having drawbacks.

They hold the harpsichord like a guitar, more towards the side, allowing them to see their left hand. These postures and atmospheres are quite endearing, all taking place in small gatherings where everyone is having fun. Unlike modern harpsichords, which only appear in concert halls and have a rigid posture, sitting upright and seriously performing.

From Viola da Gamba

During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, there was a popular instrument called the viola da gamba (viol, for short), which was a favorite of Louis XIV and had some advantages over the harpsichord. At that time, the viol was considered a more prestigious instrument than the harpsichord, and wealthier households would have a cabinet for their viols, containing various sizes. Alas, history is ever-changing, good things often fail to gain recognition. Although it is no longer popular now, you can still buy this instrument, and there are still people performing beautiful music on it. Bach's student Carl Friedrich Abel composed important works for it. Bach himself also composed some music for this instrument.

There is a French film called "Tous les Matins du Monde" (Chinese title: "The Sorrowful Dawns of the World," available on Youku), which tells the story of a musician Marin Marais and his teacher Sainte-Colombe. They used the viol. This film's scenes and music are both extremely beautiful. You can notice their posture, including the posture of the viol. Compared to the posture of holding a modern cello like carrying a rocket launcher to the front line, the posture of the viol is much more relaxed and elegant.

The neck of the viol has gut strings as frets (frets), so finding the notes is much easier than with a viola or cello. There are more strings, and the angles are not as steep, allowing for the playing of major and minor chords. Although this may not be advantageous, we should know that such a method exists, and the difficulties of using the viol may not be necessary.

According to Wikipedia's Chinese version, the reason why the viol fell out of favor later is:

Because it could not produce the brilliance and infectious effect of the violin, it began to fall out of favor in the late seventeenth century, gradually being replaced by the viola da gamba and the bowing and fingering techniques of the viol and the bass viol.: The Wikipedia English version states:

Viols fell out of use as concert halls grew larger and the louder and more penetrating tone of the violin family became more popular.

Translation: Viols were no longer popular because concert halls became larger, resulting in greater volume, and the smaller, more penetrating tone of the violin family became more preferred. People chose the larger and smaller violins based on volume and the so-called "penetrating power." The volume of the larger violins is indeed large, to the point of worrying neighbors and even damaging one's own hearing. Is this all for the sake of beauty, or for practicality? I cannot help but suspect the abandonment of the viols was due to human folly, just like in the computer field where people chose "object-oriented languages."

Comparing the Wikipedia Chinese and English versions, you will find that the Chinese author and English author have significant differences in their understanding of the situation. Try listening to the sound of a viol, you will find that the Chinese Wikipedia version cannot be further from the truth. How many valuable things have been buried in such misinformation throughout history?

I have more faith in the English version, as people chose the larger and smaller violins based on volume and the so-called "penetrating power." The volume of the larger violins is indeed large, to the point of worrying neighbors and even damaging one's own hearing. Is this all for the sake of beauty, or for practicality? I cannot help but suspect the abandonment of the viols was due to human folly, just like in the computer field where people chose "object-oriented languages." "Yes, back to the topic. The grip with the thumb and index finger has a notable advantage, as they both rest on the bow hair. They can feel the vibration of the strings and adjust the tension of the bow hair, resulting in subtle tonal variations. Additionally, I found that the wrist of the hand using this grip is more relaxed and agile, allowing for subtle tremolo effects.

People can choose their preferred grip, but many cello students may never have tried these methods, as they have been told by their teachers what is "correct posture," including where each finger should go and how the thumb should be curved. If they don't follow these instructions, they are not allowed to continue learning. Through personal experience, I feel that music teachers have a more authoritative attitude compared to art teachers, whether domestic or foreign. We are dealing with a refined art form, and you must do as I say.

### Is it wrong to squeeze the bow with the left-hand pinky?

Another seemingly misleading teaching in cello instruction is the advice given by cello teachers: "When playing, the pinky of the left hand should not squeeze the neck of the cello. The weight of the arm should press down the strings, while the pinky should only lightly touch the neck, like holding a grape, not with force." I tried this method and found that it made my left-hand movements unstable. If the pinky uses no force at all, the cello relies on the chest to stay stable, but the chest is not a stable support point. The cello body rests on the chest, and the neck is actually in mid-air, so if the pinky does not use force, pressing the strings will not be stable. Furthermore, the pressure of the other three fingers on the neck of the cello is much greater than that of the pinky, which is unnatural."

This confusion was also clarified by observing the posture in the above Baroque cello and violin poses in the video. You may notice that in this stance, due to the more vertical angle, the chest does not exert much force to hold the cello, and if the strings are pressed firmly on the fingerboard, the fingerboard only receives force from one direction, making it impossible to maintain balance, so the pinky definitely needs to provide support from behind." From Jordi Savall's viol performance video, you can see that his index finger steadily supports the neck of the viol. The neck of the viol keeps swinging back and forth, indicating that the support from his chest is minimal. Although it may not look like his index finger is applying much pressure, this is not the force of a "strawberry" that can withstand it. The viol also is not completely supported by the index finger for balance, as he would not be able to use his left hand to adjust his eyeglasses.

On the other hand, in the video, there is another viol performer (Philippe Pierlot) whose posture is almost clinging to the neck of the viol, enjoying it. His viol is not at all resting on his chest, only his legs provide the lower support. At times, he even lifts the entire viol up when it slides down. Therefore, his index finger is mostly using force, and if he lets go, the viol will fall.

Can such a posture be explained from a mechanical perspective?

In old Baroque paintings, you can find several cello players supporting the cello neck with their left hand. With this posture, the index finger cannot help but squeeze. You might argue that the figures in the painting are models rather than real musicians. But if you search for "cello painting baroque," you will find that most of them are in this posture. If it's just one painting, it might be the artist's embellishment. But with so many historical paintings all showing this posture, it makes one wonder if they really played the cello this way in the past.1. Big cello teachers often tell you that the thumb is a problem, pressing the cello neck with the thumb can make it difficult to achieve vibrato (vibrato, commonly referred to as "rubbing the strings"), and difficult to change bow positions. However, I feel that the Baroque musicians' posture contradicts this. The string should be pressed down naturally and stably with the thumb behind it, producing a counteracting force, and it feels comfortable and enjoyable. As for vibrato, even if the thumb presses on it, there should be a way to achieve it, and vibrato itself is not something that can be used excessively.

2. In the Baroque era, music used vibrato less frequently and instead used another method called trill, which involves lightly touching the string with another finger instead of rubbing it with the same finger. In modern cello concertos (such as Schumann, Dvorak, Elgar's Cello Concerto), vibrato is used extensively, sometimes vibrato after vibrato, and the amplitude is large, like mosquitoes flying back and forth, or like someone singing and shaking their legs at the same time, making the audience's mind unsettled. Mozart's father Leopold, a violinist, had a similar view of excessive use of vibrato. He said, "A performer who vibrates every note is like someone with palsy."

3. This type of concerto and symphony is usually long and tedious, with a few new ideas at the beginning but lacking in aesthetics, and then filled with countless borrowed clichéd patterns, turning it into a long, monotonous piece, reminiscent of Mozart's style. It often becomes silent without sound, only to suddenly startle the audience, making them bored but unable to fall asleep. Whenever someone says this music is too long and boring, someone else always says you don't understand, this music is telling a story, you need to savor the nuances. I used to believe them, thinking it was my lack of understanding. Now I understand, this music indeed tells a story, just like the countless identical crossover novels and TV dramas on the internet, and like the software industry's "design patterns."

4. I can't even listen to this modern cello concerto, let alone play it. Listening to these modern cello concertos, I began to doubt the significance of studying the cello. To be honest, if it weren't for Pablo Casals' performance of Bach's cello suites, I would have thought that the cello was only used to provide bass in an orchestra and had no reason to study it. The best cellists who perform these modern cello concertos (such as Mstislav Rostropovich, Jacqueline du Pre) have performed Bach's cello suites, and they are truly unlistenable, probably because they overuse the metronome and lack expressiveness, making it sound like the performances of some schoolchildren.

5. However, their performances of these modern cello concertos are world-class, indicating the vast difference between modern cello composers and Bach. Although modern cello concertos are difficult for me to listen to, Rostropovich's performance of Vivaldi's cello concertos is still quite good. Vivaldi's cello concertos are all very short, but from C.P.E Bach onwards, they begin to be monotonous and lacking in imagination, and they become lengthy. C.P.E Bach marked the beginning of the classical era, and regardless of who composed the music of this era, it all tasted the same. if you want to learn more about how people talk about vibrato from this paper, you can refer to it. When I perform Bach's cello suites on LinnStrument, I usually don't use vibrato for the opening and middle notes, but sometimes naturally want to make it sway slightly for the long series of notes at the end. This happens to be what several authors refer to as "the natural timing of vibrato."

Determined not to listen to or perform contemporary cello ensembles, I suddenly felt enlightened and more comfortable in my posture. If you don't perform this kind of music with excessive vibrato, removing the "can't grip the neck" posture dogma, allowing the index finger to grip the neck, pressing the strings becomes easier and more stable. You can place the neck on your body to the left side or other positions, instead of insisting on pressing it against your chest. You can even see the left hand movements and position on the cello. Observe the performance videos of viol and Baroque cello players; they all hold the neck to the left, allowing them to see their left hand, and pressing the strings is simple.

If you carefully observe the performance videos of modern Baroque cello players, you will find that they not only use their index finger with force but also often extend the other four fingers to press the strings. Because several notes often need to be pressed at the same time, especially when one finger needs to press two strings, this is a natural way to use force without any problems. Therefore, my experience is that any posture that feels natural to you, but others tell you not to do it, you should carefully consider what they mean.

Not every person wants to abandon that kind of music rich in vibrato, but we should clarify that not every cello student needs to perform that music. Blindly making students adopt the "can't grip the neck" method to use the cello based on that kind of music significantly hinders early learning progress. If you don't grip the neck, just relying on "arm weight" to press the strings, it will be particularly unstable. To achieve a goal that not everyone wants, making their learning difficulty increase several fold is not a reasonable teaching method. In my opinion, students should first master finding the correct pitch and practicing ear training to distinguish sounds, and the initial pressing of the string is not as crucial. Once you find the pitch, these postures can be easily changed later, and gripping the neck lightly is not a significant issue.

These Baroque instruments can grip the neck because their string tension is not significant (gut strings, 415Hz), and the string height is very low, so pressing the strings is very effortless. Modern cellos have steel strings, 440Hz tuning, high string tension, and high bridges to increase volume, making pressing the strings very laborious for beginners, and even masters often need to use two fingers to press the strings. If you use your index finger with force, it will put significant pressure on the index finger and affect vibrato and string changes. I believe that the various irrationalities, expedient designs, lack of taste in modern cello compositions, and authoritative atmosphere in the cello world, have led to this "wrong posture" orthodoxy. Observing historical scenes and other instruments has given me new insights. By observing them, I came to understand the various misunderstandings in the cello realm. All stringed instruments can be supported by the thumb pressing against the neck, except for cello teachers who tell you not to do it. I couldn't even escape this phenomenon by carefully selecting teachers. A week before my first lesson, I tried out two teachers in different places, and touched the cello for the first time and plucked a few open strings. The second time I tried the lesson, the teacher seemed surprised and said, "You really have never played the cello before, and yet you're already producing such a good sound." I replied, "This is my second try." In truth, at the time, I was thinking, "What's so surprising about plucking a string? Isn't it similar to the motion of cutting with a knife?"

However, this did not change my subsequent fate. I attended four lessons in a month, all of which were about posture, rigidly posed like a puppet. I finally managed to teach pulling open strings in the third lesson, thinking that I would be able to move my left hand in the next lesson. However, he came to check the open strings and scolded me, "When you lower the bow to the tip, the angle isn't vertical to the string, is it? I said, "I thought it was vertical to the cello string?" He replied, "No, you need to look at the oblique angle, that's the correct angle." You should look at it in the mirror at home and use a triangle to measure it. Come, I'll show you with my hand, pull along this straight line. Wait a minute, your little finger has gone up again? I told you to put it in the circle."

Another lesson passed, and I still hadn't moved my left hand. When I got home and looked in the mirror and measured it with a triangle, I realized that my previous posture was indeed vertical. Couldn't I judge whether two static lines in space are vertical just by looking at them? If I made such an error based on different viewpoints, how could I possibly play ping-pong or tennis well? Those require judging the spatial angle relationships of moving objects, which is much more difficult than pulling a bow. Many violin teachers may not have made things clear: the direction perpendicular to the string is not just one, but countless, as it is a plane. The violin bow needs to be in this plane, but it doesn't have to move in a straight line, instead, it can choose different angles in this plane, as long as it doesn't touch adjacent strings. The angle of the bow in this plane can be different for various bowing directions, even adjusting the angle midway to alter pressure and friction angles, producing the best sound from the violin string.

In reality, the "vertical" and "straight line" aspects are not as crucial as one might think. The most important thing in music is the sound, not the angle and posture. Often, the violin bow doesn't even need to be perpendicular to the string. Different angles produce different sounds and serve different purposes, and varying angles for drawing the bow can shift the contact point between the bow and string, altering the tone. I learned all this from various teaching videos. Pablo Casals' videos, in particular, stand out. He often pulls the C string with a steep angle, producing a subtle low sound. I have tried this myself, and the sound is indeed better than a vertical pull. Obsessing over angles, insisting on being vertical, and then criticizing when it's not, feels like being fooled.

In some ways, I feel that Casals is my teacher. Just observing him teaching others decades ago through videos has taught me more than one-on-one private lessons. He wasn't just a great cellist; he also understood the essence of music. I loved his repeated advice to students: "Don't play exactly according to the score!"; "The score isn't written that way, but that's the idea!" His language was authoritative, and his tone was endearing. I wish I had a teacher like that.

Unfortunately, I spent an entire month of lessons messing with such details, not even practicing an exercise piece or hitting a single note with my left hand. The first lesson was about body posture, the second about bow hold, the third about open string posture, and the fourth about empty strings, constantly nitpicking angles and hand positions. The material that should have been covered in one lesson was dragged out for an entire month. During the week-long breaks, if I wasn't learning from videos, I had little to do. At home, I learned from Beethoven cello pieces on YouTube and practiced several sections.

Later, I met a violin teacher who told me she taught students the same way, saying that many domestic violin and violin teachers do. You must place your fingers correctly, the bow must be very straight, and after pulling empty strings for a couple of months, you are allowed to learn other things. She also mentioned that they are reluctant to teach adults because adults are often too busy and eventually stop coming to class. I understand the reasoning behind this. Mature individuals with understanding ability and life experience are less likely to accept rigid teaching methods, unwilling to be corrected on insignificant matters. I have discovered through this period that in China, people attach great importance to rhythm in music and love to use metronomes, while in general, foreigners only use metronomes in necessary places. Chinese children's posture and rhythm are very "correct," but they lack emotion and expressiveness, just like a painting made with a ruler and a compass. This is not about music education, but rather manufacturing robots. True music education should make children instantly fall in love with the instrument, not just see hardship and tedium. This might be why China has not produced good musicians and artists, as every child has a talent, yet they have all been buried by this.

### The Real Principle of Playing the Qin

Don't you think the qin bow is similar to a toothbrush? The only difference is that the toothbrush brushes teeth, while the qin bow brushes strings. However, children should be careful. The qin is held horizontally, while the hand should be held vertically. But sometimes, in order to make the object reach a certain angle, it needs to bend a little.

If you observe carefully, brushing your teeth is more complex than playing the qin. The index finger sometimes goes here, sometimes there, and sometimes even rests on the toothbrush. The little finger also goes everywhere, sometimes on top, sometimes bent down below. But we don't notice these things without paying attention. Have your parents taught you where each finger should be placed on the toothbrush? They only tell you how to move the toothbrush, telling you not to brush horizontally, and to brush every corner.

When eating with a fork or spoon, have you been taught where each finger should be placed and at what angle? You naturally find a convenient way yourself. If the fork or spoon is hard and doesn't move, you change the position temporarily. Holding a qin bow and a fork or spoon, forks and spoons are very different. Do you remember when the tip of your index finger was bent and when it was straight while eating? Anyway, I don't remember, it seems to know what to do by itself. I need to observe my index finger closely to understand its state and why it behaves that way.much like ping pong paddles, how should they be held? There are many grip methods. There is the straight grip, the shakehand grip, each with world-class masters. Our country's world champion, for instance, has an unusual grip, even having a custom-made paddle, making it difficult to deal with his serves.

I think people don't understand, the crucial thing here isn't "which finger should be placed where" type of "methods." The crucial thing is "the motion of the object" as the "goal."

For violin, the goal is actually this: hold the bow, make it move approximately in a straight line in the vertical direction of the strings, and produce a uniform sound by friction. When you pull the bow to the end, due to the decreasing bow-string force, the sound becomes quieter, so you can press a little or just let it weaken naturally. When releasing the bow, if the string vibrates strongly, the bow cannot suddenly stop but should release pressure and send it out a little more, otherwise it will collide with the string vibration and produce unwanted sound. This is why you often see the hand shaking slightly when someone pulls the bow to the end. At this moment, the hand cannot be tensed, or the bow will suddenly stop moving and produce unwanted sound.

This is similar to ping pong, when a spinning ball comes, you cannot hit it directly back, but should slightly change the paddle's angle and shake the hand slightly to neutralize the ball's spin, preventing it from flying away. A better approach is not only neutralizing the ball's spin but also rotating it in the opposite direction. For example, if the opponent serves a topspin ball, you return a backspin ball, which follows the same principle.

If you carefully observe the vibration of the string being pulled by the bow under high-speed camera recording, you will find that it doesn't swing back and forth in a plane but rather rotates around a central axis, forming a flattened ellipsoid shape, like some rotating balls or more precisely, like a long jump rope. The vibration of the string pulled by the bow and that of the string plucked by hand are different, the former is an ellipsoid rotating, the latter only oscillates in a plane. In fact, you don't need a high-speed camera, you can verify this through simple experiments yourself.1. Because the strings of a viola da gamba are propelled to rotate by the bow, therefore, when drawing the bow, you need to make the strings rotate in the opposite direction, which is essentially drawing the ball back. If the viola da gamba suddenly reverses or returns too quickly, the strings will produce strange noises, like a ping-pong ball being hit. So, my feeling is that playing the viola da gamba is actually a sport. Pulling the strings of the viola da gamba sometimes feels like drawing a ball, and other times like tossing a ball.

2. A quote says it well: "Musicians are athletes who use small muscle movements."

3. The rotating strings model can not only explain the drawing-back action, but also clarify many other practices in playing the viola da gamba. For instance, when you are close to the bridge (bridge) and pull the string, you cannot pull quickly, and you need to press harder. The rotating strings model can explain this.

4. When Ma Yufeng was seven years old, he met Pablo Casals and performed a piece for him. Casals said after Ma Yufeng's performance, "Your playing of the viola da gamba is good, but you should also go play baseball!" Do you understand the meaning behind this? Because playing the viola da gamba is similar to swinging a baseball bat. These types of sports can train a person's spatial perception ability and improve their positioning and operational ability of the instrument. That's why many Chinese parents force their children to study musical instruments on weekends but don't let them play and participate in sports, resulting in children who can't do anything well because they lack the ability to control the movement of objects.

5. If the viola da gamba teacher can tell students these principles and the objectives of these movements, pulling an open string will no longer be a dull and tasteless task. Just like playing ping-pong, every warm-up involves drawing the ball back and forth. Kicking a soccer ball, every warm-up involves using various parts of the body to toss the ball. Our motor system adjusts based on the feedback from these warm-up movements, making formal movements more fluid. Tossing a soccer ball can be more fun? In middle school, I often tossed the ball with both feet, sometimes tossing over 200 times without it touching the ground. Tossing the ball makes the motor system so familiar with the ball's physical properties that passing and shooting angles can be done at will. The focus is on the motion of objects, not human posture. All human postures are for the sake of the target. Once you know the target, after some trials, your fingers will naturally take the required shape, and every joint will move in the appropriate direction. Each person's arms and fingers are different in length, angle, and joint movement trajectory. One person's perceived correct position may not be correct for another, but they will automatically adjust their posture to achieve the goal. This is the wonder of the human body.

The teaching of violin is the same, as for learning boxing, swordsmanship, and so on, there are similar misunderstandings. The teacher usually teaches you to assume a stance, but they won't tell you that these angles, positions, and twists are ultimately for sending the fist or sword along a straight line to hit the target with maximum speed and power at the moment of impact. Students won't be able to do the optimal stance right away, but the optimal stance isn't something that can be corrected with a ruler. Only by knowing the target can one achieve the best stance.

The same goes for tennis and other sports. For tennis, the student should be encouraged to get on the court and take some hits first, then be told that the ball's inertia is significant, so you need to swing the racket early and use the ball's inertia to return the ball. Then, your grip style, various power angles, and timing will naturally adjust. However, most tennis coaches rigidly teach body posture while neglecting explaining the laws of motion of the ball and racket.

This rigid teaching is why Wang Hao, a tennis prodigy, was overwhelmed after taking one tennis lesson at Tsinghua University. I watched tennis matches on TV as a child, imagining that if I ever had a tennis racket and a court, I would play like that, and if the ball came flying at me, I would hit it back like that... Years later, the first time I stepped onto the court, I was able to use a professional over-the-head stance to serve, and the second time I was able to counter with a low-angle backhand kill. My companions were surprised, and they recommended I take tennis lessons. However, the first lesson was filled with posture drills, leaving me feeling foolish, and I eventually gave up due to a lack of a suitable sparring partner.1. Timothy Gallwey's book "The Inner Game of Tennis" states that tennis coaching cannot be completed by giving students a hundred details of instructions, criticizing and correcting their actions. The best way is to demonstrate repeatedly for the student. The student observes, their subconscious mimics the teacher's actions, unconsciously practicing in their mind, and eventually learns on their own. This is known as "thinking while playing tennis." I have been doing this since I was young, and my "coach" was Agassi.

2. I have heard Timothy Gallwey's statement for a long time, and I often find its effectiveness. Unfortunately, most teachers in the world do not understand this principle. It is interesting to note that when you watch Pablo Casals' masterclass videos on YouTube, you will find that he completed teaching by demonstrating and letting students mimic. Casals was a good teacher.

3. The posture for painting is the same. Some teachers will tell you that the pencil must be held in this way, the angle of the arm should be this when drawing lines, and then you end up drawing some unrefined things with rigid line strokes.

4. The keyboard typing also exhibits a similar phenomenon. Many people insist that the backspace key belongs to the right small finger's "work area," so they always stretch out their small finger to press that key. However, I found that my ring finger is longer than my small finger, and it is the most convenient finger to reach that key. So I have always used my ring finger to press backspace, and my small finger is much more relaxed.

5. Therefore, in terms of the posture for various activities, I believe that people's teaching is misguided. Understanding the "movement of objects" as the goal, rather than fixating on the specific posture of people, is the key to teaching such motor skills. The human motor system has a very advanced "goal-driven" mechanism, and once a target is specified, the motor system automatically adjusts itself through multiple trials to reach the target. Being conscious of the details can make you stiff and even injured. I started playing the cello a month in, and I was lucky. I wouldn't be like other people, blindly working hard, giving my body to this instrument in a desperate struggle. Many people may not understand that "music" and "instrument" are two different things. A true music lover, his instrument doesn't have to play that well, he knows the flaws of various instruments, so he doesn't struggle with them. A person who plays an instrument exceptionally well may not truly understand music.

When I see certain professional cello performers' left hands on videos, I find it distressing. Many of them are callouses, and many callouses are torn, like exploded firecrackers. Some people, due to using the "German fingering," force their index and middle fingers apart and place them on two notes at the same time, causing their joints to deform.

Is this what they call "dedicating oneself to music"? Even if I love music, my hands shouldn't be sacrificed to those so-called "professional performance level" steel strings, or to the high strings' design for "large volume." To truly enjoy music, I must break free from these dogmas, discard all unnatural finger position designs that deform fingers. After all, my goal is enjoyment, not to be like many music students and parents, striving for "distinction." I will make it easier, more comfortable, become its master, its friend, not its servant.

If there is any music that forces me to use deformed movements, I will abandon that music or redesign the instrument. I find that many of the difficulties in instruments are not inherent. The cello, piano, they may not be more advanced in design than their Baroque predecessors, and in some cases, they may even be regressive. For example, Bach's Goldberg Variations were originally written for a two-manual harpsichord, intended for music lovers to practice and amuse themselves. If you haven't seen one, a harpsichord looks like this:1. Modern people believe that piano is more advanced than harpsichord, but playing these pieces on the piano turns out to be much more difficult. Not only because the piano keys are too wide, but also because it doesn't have a double keyboard, resulting in hands crossing and swapping positions frequently. People who can play these pieces are revered as geniuses.

2. Most people pride themselves on difficulties, using unreasonable tools and postures, striving towards "peaks." Although they cannot play Bach's Goldberg Variations, they still revere Glenn Gould. Real music connoisseurs, to enjoy Baroque music, have bought harpsichords from antique markets and comfortably play Goldberg Variations at home.

3. Bach's cello suites were not originally written for modern cellos with five strings, but for some instrument with five strings, which might not even be a cello. Some pieces (like Bach's Sixth Suite for Cello) use modern cellos with four strings, making them difficult, as the high notes often run under the "thumb position," but those who can play them are often admired, and others consider them as prodigies.

4. Many cellists may not have considered that these challenging "thumb positions" (thumb position), in fact, could be eliminated with an additional string, allowing normal posture.

5. The reason Bach's Baroque cello soundboards were not long is that instead of extending the soundboard, it would be better to add an additional string. In fact, in Bach's time, playing the cello did not involve using the thumb, and Bach never imagined that future performers would start using the thumb instead of modifying their instruments.: Based on a report from Japan about a five-string cello research, the reason cellists don't use five-string cellos is still a mystery. They seem to prefer dealing with four-string cellos, but few have successfully performed Bach's Sixth Suite for cellos. One possible reason might be that if there are five strings, the cello body won't vibrate as powerfully as a four-string cello, resulting in a smaller volume. Volume is indeed important.

But Bach was sneakingly enjoying himself in the background: I just compose, you work hard to perform, it doesn't matter what instrument you use, people will still remember my name! Whether it's composing or instrument design, the wisdom of the Baroque era seems to have been lost. However, we still see various videos romanticizing various instruments (especially pianos), equating them with music itself, describing them as magnificent unchangeable things, worth enduring various inconveniences, even sacrificing health and life. But instruments are not music, I appreciate music, but I don't feel the need to be so "loyal" to any instrument.
