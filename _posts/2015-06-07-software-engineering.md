title: "Alluded to as Software Engineering"
---


Many programmers among us carry the title of "software engineer," but I don't like this title. I prefer to be called a "programmer" or a "computer scientist." Why is that? This requires discussing the real meaning of "software engineering."

Some people summarize the essence of the software engineering domain as: "How to program if you cannot?" I think this sentence is good, as I have found that the entire software industry is mostly about selling "weight loss pills" in the guise of software engineering. The bizarre and naive behaviors in the software industry are mostly invented by so-called "software engineering experts."

Someone always comes up with a set of so-called "methodologies" or "principles," such as Extreme Programming, Design Patterns, Agile, Pair Programming, Test Driven Development (TDD), DRY principle... They sell these supposed methodologies to various software companies, extolling their various benefits, claiming that using these methods, one can produce high-quality, low-cost software with ordinary "software engineers." This is just like weight loss drug advertisements: no exercise, no dieting, lose 20 pounds in a week.

At first, you might not believe that such shallow talk can have any impact. However, over time, these supposed "methodologies" and "principles" have become the dogma of the entire industry, creating a cultural revolution-like atmosphere. Those who violate these dogmas are ridiculed like beginners, educated like schoolchildren, and criticized like counter-revolutionaries. Even if your technology skills exceed those of the methodology's proponents by unknown multiples, it is of no avail, as they have already established their position through their eloquence. I. Breaking the Software Engineering Illusion: A Solution, is to physically check what "experts" have created using their methods. You will be surprised to find that these so-called "experts" who coin various new terms, have barely emerged from the depths of obscurity. They have no connection to real computer scientists or brilliant programmers, and have not produced anything of technical substance. They have no business giving programming advice to others. These people have produced a few things of some use (such as JUnit), which is so easy that every beginner in programming should be able to do it. How low should a programmer's experience be, to care about what such people say?

II. In the world, there are such lucrative careers, although they cannot write good code and have a very superficial understanding of computation, they can still gain the power to evaluate others' "code quality" through their talk, and occupy managerial positions in software companies. Over time, people come to believe they are some kind of masters. Have you closely examined those who proposed the "Design Patterns" known as the "Gang of Four" (GoF), produced anything of substance? The author of the "DRY Principle," produced anything? Look at the proposers of Agile, Pair Programming, and TDD? They actually know very little about programming, and their articles and books are extremely superficial.

III. So-called "software engineering" is different from civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering, which are based on real, scientific foundations. Unlike these "hard engineering" fields, software engineering mishaps do not result in loss of human life, nor do they cause a software company to suffer billions of dollars in losses due to a single bug, as in the semiconductor industry.

IV. Researching software engineering seems particularly easy to fall into a rabbit hole, fail, and then find excuses and scapegoats. If you say my method is not good, do you have any evidence? You speak without foundation, how much time have I wasted on you? Your specific execution is not completely in line with what I said, so you failed. In short, if my method doesn't work for you, it's your problem!

Bringing up these excuses reminds me of a joke: Two husbands discovered bedbugs and were bitten many times. They bought a supposedly "100% effective" bedbug medicine and scattered it on the bed. The next morning, they woke up and found they had been bitten by new bugs. The wife blamed the husband, saying he hadn't read the instructions properly. The husband opened the instructions and read: [End of Text]: Method of using jumping roach medicine:

1. Grab the jumping roach
2. Open its mouth
3. Put the medicine in its mouth
4. Close its mouth. I discovered that many so-called methodologies in software engineering fail after implementation, resembling the explanations on snake oil remedies.

People want to save money, hiring high-quality programmers is not easy, so many companies still fell for it. They invited these "software engineering experts" to the company, promoting various methods. Promoting so-called agile, awkwardly implementing stand-up meetings, scrum, and other formalistic things, believing that these seemingly simple practices could improve development quality and efficiency. However, all ended in failure. Why is that? Because no matter how sophisticated the methodology, it cannot replace genuine, essential computer science education.
