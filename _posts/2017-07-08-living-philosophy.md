title: "Living Philosophy"
---

I once wrote an article titled 'Programming Wisdom'. Due to my frequent writing of technical articles, some people might think I'm a tech obsessive, only capable of talking about technology and unable to live. However, those who know me closely know that I'm a very capable person in life.

I have put a lot of thought into various items and their usage and organization. I approach every aspect of life in a rational and wise manner. My "life wisdom" is not inferior to my "programming wisdom". In fact, the origins of these two kinds of wisdom are the same, they both come from a person's inner self, from their nature.

A disorganized and untidy person, who doesn't tidy up or arrange things, hurries around and doesn't spend money, their code is probably not much better. Conversely, if someone is very organized in their life, they cannot forgive themselves for writing disorganized and complex code. These people also have another characteristic, they spend money wisely, rather than being stingy, causing inconvenience to themselves.

In fact, if you start pondering wisdom in life, you will find that many programming algorithms can be directly applied to life. Conversely, the mundane wisdom of life can also inspire programming ideas. I. Organizing the Room

When it comes to applications of algorithms in daily life, the first thing that comes to mind is organizing a room. How to arrange and place various items in a room to make it look attractive, cozy, not take up too much space, and be easily accessible and put away after use? You might not think so, but item management is related to a common programming concept, that is Huffman coding.

Organizing a room, which seems simple, has consumed a lot of people's lives without fully understanding it. Although many people's houses are relatively clean, the items are placed randomly without rules or organization. They are reluctant to spend money to buy appropriate tools, so they encounter the following problems:

- You can't find the things you need to use.
- Many items are placed in shabby places, and every time you use them, you have to move other things first. After use, you have to move those things again.1. At home, there are too many things, insufficient space to place them, yet unwilling to discard any of them.

2. Our home actually has ample storage space, with many cabinets and drawers, but due to the lack of reasonable organization, we cannot accommodate many things.

3. Some items, due to their size and shape, are unsure of where to place them, and wherever they are placed seems awkward.

Many people encounter this problem every day but, due to it being "a small matter in life," they have never seriously considered it, even thinking they are busy people who earn a lot of money and therefore have no need to solve such problems. But I am different; whenever I encounter such problems, I approach them with the same serious and rational mindset as solving programming problems, and as a result, I often come up with practical solutions.

In managing items, I have a general "wisdom" akin to Huffman coding. In Huffman coding, the most frequently used characters are represented by the shortest codes, while less frequently used characters are represented by longer codes. Applying this concept to life means placing the most frequently used items in easily accessible locations, and placing less frequently used items in less easily accessible locations. I'll give an example, toothbrush and toothpaste are used every day, so I put them directly on the countertop in the bathroom. Salt for bathing is not used every day, so I put it in the lower cabinet. The less frequently used items, the farther back their positions in the cabinet are.

### Consumable goods, disposable goods

I found that there are too many household items, it seems there's no space for storing them, and they haven't carefully thought about what they "need." They can't bear to throw away old things, even if they'll never use them again. They tell themselves: "These things cost so much money back then. Can't bear to throw them away!" Or say: "Although this thing has no value, frugality is our honorable tradition, accumulate little by little. Throw this out, throw that out, where will the money for buying a house come from!"

From a programming and design perspective, such people have not understood the concept of "minimalism," and they haven't made a rational calculation and analysis of the value of items, and they blindly idolize so-called "frugality."

Technical and design people might have seen the story of Jobs designing his room, as well as that iconic photograph. Jobs sat in the middle of the room with only one lamp, there was nothing else... You might not have thought, every time I move to a remote place, I start living like this. I will select the items I most want to keep from my possessions, and send the others to people, sell them, or throw them away. I will buy a lamp and a mattress when I move to a new place, making it possible for me to see at night and have a sleeping place within a week. Then, I will quickly go to the store to choose a very comfortable bed, willing to pay a lot for it. Bedding, bedsheets, pillows, and other personal items directly affect people's rest and health, so I am willing to spend money on them. You may not know that the quality of these things makes a big difference.

Then I will carefully consider what other things I need. I will not buy anything I see at the store, and every time I buy a new item, I will ask myself this question: "Do I need this item? Does it conflict with the function of existing items? Is it better than similar items in terms of advantages? Is it of better quality, more convenient, more attractive, or cozier? Will it cause any inconvenience? Will it take up too much space? Is the value it brings worth the drawbacks?"

I will weigh all these requirements. If I don't have a similar function item, I will search online for similar items and see if there are better ones, then choose the best one based on my judgment and other people's evaluations. I often use the unconditional return policy of American stores and Amazon. For similar functional items, I sometimes buy several different ones and keep the best one after using it for a few days, returning the others. Sometimes I give them away or throw them away when they can't be returned or have passed the return period.

It may seem cruel and wasteful, but once I have chosen a product, I will remember it and remember why I chose it and what the shortcomings of similar products are. The next time I buy similar items, I will use the wisdom I have accumulated and only compare them to new items, not repeat the same process. This way, I won't cause unnecessary inconvenience and waste for merchants.

Due to this minimalist approach, there are few excess items in my house. what is waste

Many people blindly oppose "waste," believing we should be thrifty, keeping things that could still be used or eating food that could still be consumed, and therefore always finishing what they bought or cooked or ordered at a restaurant. They fail to rationally understand that using inferior or unsafe products harms their bodies or minds, that eating too much food damages their bodies, affects their sleep, and that is the real waste.

Using high-quality, safe products, discarding inferior ones, not eating excessively, appears to be wasteful of money, but in fact saves money. Many people, especially older Chinese, greatly undervalue their bodies and health. In their youth, they strive to save every penny, neglecting their bodies. Because they cannot bear to throw away old things and buy new ones, they create various inconveniences and discomforts in their lives.

As they grow older, they find their bodies are not as good as before, and many problems begin to emerge. Due to their thriftiness, they do not find good doctors, do not use the best medical products and equipment, and therefore cannot treat problems early. As time goes on, the problems become more severe, and eventually reach a point of no return. In the end, they spend all the money they had saved, and even more, yet they still cannot fully protect their bodies....

Regarding waste, I believe everyone should do some rational analysis and settle their accounts. You may spend a few thousand dollars now to solve a problem in your life, which might save you several tens of thousands in the future. Some people are meticulous about every penny, calculating for several decades, but how much can they save in total? Some people can't help but buy bulk bags of specialized garbage bags for a few cents each, using supermarket bags instead for garbage. These bags often get torn by items while carrying, causing kitchen garbage to leak and emit a foul smell, making it difficult to clean. I have never used supermarket bags for garbage because specialized garbage bags don't leak. They are reliable and cheap, so what's the point of saving that little money?

Rational people will "optimize" and save in this way, which is the algorithmic mindset. My strategy is to save more on expensive items and relax a bit on less expensive ones. For instance, I spent several days researching and bought a good, inexpensive, and durable car model, saving several tens of thousands of dollars compared to others. Then I can afford to spend more on personal care items, buying the safest and most comfortable ones. I don't mind spending a few thousand on good doctors and advanced medical facilities to maintain my body's best condition. Although it cost a lot, it's just a small change compared to the savings from buying a car.

Compared to this, I know some people who drive a Porsche but have poor quality and poorly arranged household items, lacking essentials, and are reluctant to spend money on their children's doctors when they get sick. They save on almost all other expenses to buy a Porsche, and I'm amazed :P

### Price and Value

Another wise thing is that the quality of goods is not always determined by the price. Many people think that the most expensive things are the best because they don't know how to distinguish good goods, so they let the price guide their choices. Through countless comparisons, I found that good products are not always the most expensive, although they can indeed be the most expensive. I'll give an example, many people think that Beats headphones are the best because they're expensive. However, after researching online reviews and trying them myself, I found that these popular high-end brands are not as great as people think. In fact, Beats headphones have one of the worst sound profiles, with sound being very muddled and harsh, making it difficult to distinguish the rhythm of the music.

Later, I discovered a type of headphones called "studio monitoring headphones" for professional recording engineers. Since they prioritize the accurate reproduction of music instead of indiscriminately boosting bass to create a rhythmic feel, I found the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 and AKG K-712. These two models are not very expensive, but their sound quality is on par with Beats' most expensive models, and they are much more comfortable. I later found that anyone who knows their stuff usually has an ATH-M50.

If you're looking for a Bluetooth headphone, try the AKG Y50BT.

However, after considering my "needs," I realized that I didn't actually need these high-quality over-ear headphones. They're bulky and not convenient to carry around, and they cover the ears, making them prone to causing discomfort from the heat. I don't need such high sound quality? In truth, some earbuds with decent sound quality can already meet my requirements, lightweight and won't make my ears feel stuffy. Although I spent several hundred dollars on two big headphones, the one I use most at the office is actually lightweight and affordable earbuds. The ATH-M50 sits on my desk, used only a few times. Later, these two headphones were given away by me :P

Lately, I have been loving the 1More ibfree, which is a very lightweight Bluetooth earbuds.

This story tells me that everyone's demands are different, you must start from your own demands, not blindly pursuing some best quality, such as sound quality. The value of headphones for me is not just about sound quality, but also whether it is portable and whether the earbuds are comfortable. After considering so many aspects, I found that I can actually slightly lower my "feverish" pursuit of sound quality.

### Examples of affordable good products

The same principle, I found many affordable yet better quality products. For example:1. At home, I chose Hoover over the expensive Dyson vacuum cleaner with less suction power.

2. For a robot vacuum cleaner, I chose an old version of Neato instead of the most expensive iRobot, and didn't buy the WiFi remote-controlled Neato model. When I was in the country, I used Xiaomi's robot vacuum cleaner. I found that Xiaomi's robot was smarter than Neato's, could be remotely controlled, and was cheaper.

3. I bought a non-4K 55-inch Sony TV instead of an expensive 4K TV. To be honest, it looks great, and I don't feel like I'm missing anything. A 4K TV is completely unnecessary, as sources are scarce, and do people really care about that high clarity?

4. I bought several Amazon Basics Apple charging cables instead of Apple's original ones. They are more durable and feel better (plastic instead of silicone), but they are much cheaper. I bought several for each room, a few for the car, one for the office, and one for my backpack to use with my power bank. This way, I don't have to carry a charging cable around.

5. I bought a Honda Accord V6 instead of a Mercedes-Benz or BMW. To be honest, this Honda is better to drive than my girlfriend's Mercedes. The engine code was hacked by me, making it even better to drive :) I carefully selected various items based on requirements, with their functions in a "coverage but not repetition" state. Coverage refers to each requirement having an item to fulfill it, while not repetition means no repetitive items for the same requirement. This non-repetitive feature allows me to do things without having to select from different items every time.

For instance, I used to have many phone chargers. I got one with every Apple product - an iPhone charger, an iPad charger, and so on. Then I realized the iPhone charger had a slow output of only 1A. The iPad charger had a 2.2A output but only one output port. Later, I bought some Anker fast chargers with multiple output ports, each of which could dynamically change and output more than 2A, suitable for charging all USB devices.

I placed one of these chargers in every room and equipped them with enough charging cables. This way, I could charge anywhere without having to put my phone in a fixed location. Consequently, I could discard all the iPhone chargers, as I no longer desired to use them due to the Anker charger's intelligence. As for the iPad charger, I kept it for work since I only needed to charge one device, my phone, and it was both fast and met this requirement.

Similarly, every time I bought a new iPhone, I would discard its earphones and use my Symphonized earbuds instead. The iPhone earphones were far from satisfactory compared to mine, and they were prone to falling out of the ear, making them almost useless.1. Due to this kind of function for non-repeating deletion, the number of my items always stays within a reasonable and controllable range. Another advantage is that when I want to do something, I don't need to make a choice, as there is only one product capable of doing it.

2. The principle is roughly the same for furniture and clothing. If you find that you haven't used something for two years, there's a good chance you'll never use it again. Since you no longer need it, regardless of how much money you spent on it, you can throw it away, give it to someone, or sell it second-hand.

3. For items that are frequently used and necessary in multiple places, such as headphones, mobile phone chargers, computer chargers, teapots, etc., if you only bought one and need it in two places (for example, at home and at the office), you may need to carry it between the two places.

4. Some items require effort to carry every time, such as chargers that need to be unplugged and folded, headphones that need to have their cords coiled, and computer chargers that need to be unplugged and wound up. Once you arrive at your destination, you have to take these things out again and untangle the cords. Some things, like computer chargers, actually have some weight, and carrying them back and forth adds to the burden on your body, especially on hot days. Teapots are also a hassle to carry back and forth every day. if you find something that you have to carry with you every time, you might consider buying another identical item and placing them in different locations. This way, you won't have to carry it around all the time.

For example, my earphones, phone charger cables, teapot, and computer chargers are things I always buy two of. One stays at home, and the other at the office. For some items like power banks and phone cables, I keep an extra set in the car. I often forget to bring them when I go out to play, and then worry about my phone running out of battery, especially in remote wilderness areas. Having a spare set in the car ensures that I always have a backup.

Once, at a company I used to work for, an intern kept borrowing my phone charger cable, explaining, "I forgot it at home today." Borrowing someone's item occasionally is understandable, but he started borrowing mine every day because I always kept one at the office. This intern didn't understand my reasoning. A charger cable costs only a few dollars, but he preferred to borrow instead of buying one for himself, causing inconvenience for both himself and others.

### Organizing Items

After carefully selecting items, you also need to consider how to organize and store them. This is called "organizing" items. Organizing items actually involves a lot of intelligence, similar to concepts in programming. People who can't organize items well often write disorganized code that's hard to understand, as they don't understand how code should be "stored." some people only have furnished cabinets, drawers, and shelves at home, and they never buy organizational products themselves. As a result, they often find it difficult to keep things tidy, not knowing where to put them or losing track of where they put them.

This is actually the problem I mentioned in my 'Wisdom of Programming' article: if your function has too many lines of code, it will be hard to understand. If you put all the items in a large drawer, these things will be disorganized and will move around as the drawer is moved.

So, a person who understands organization a little will buy some small boxes or baskets to put in the drawer, categorizing the items and putting them in the boxes. This way, they won't move around and will be easy to find.

The same principle applies to cabinets. Many people, after getting a wardrobe, completely rely on its partitions. However, the space in a wardrobe is often quite large, so when you put a little thing in it, it occupies the entire space logically. You have to put other things in other partitions. Later, you find that the partitions are not enough, and you start putting things everywhere, making a mess. Some people like to pile up many clothes in a wardrobe partition. But this partition is quite large, so the piled-up clothes are easy to collapse like an avalanche, causing a lot of trouble.

Smart people use a useful thing called a basket. Baskets are so useful that I always consider whether a particular place needs one. My wardrobe has various large and small baskets, which categorically store my clothes: socks, underwear, T-shirts, towels, ... there is also a dirty clothes basket, a small dirty socks basket, and a basket with a comfortable towel inside for my cat to sleep in, so he doesn't sleep in other baskets and makes a mess of cat hair :P I have various baskets in my living room and kitchen. They categorically store various items: books, remote controllers, backpacks, food, spices, etc. I also have some baskets especially at the entrance, so that I can put things I need when I go out there. For example, my computer bag for work, umbrella, hats, keys, etc.

Moreover, not only do I consider size, but I also consider the warmth of these baskets. I won't use plastic boxes to store all these things. The baskets in the bedroom closet are usually made of rattan, with beautiful printed fabric inside. There are also many such baskets in the living room. The rough rattan basket at the door is for storing backpacks, which has no fabric inside because these things may be a little dirty, and sometimes they are left outside.

Wires are also a hated thing. Some people's wires are very long, making them run around chaotically. A good way to deal with this is to buy some Velcro cable ties, like those on the ThinkPad charger, to fold and tie up long cables. This way, the area around the TV cabinet will be orderly and easy to clean.

### Container surplus

Regarding storage items, there is a possibility of another extreme: too many empty containers at home. Some people like to keep the packaging boxes of items and food bottles, thinking they can be used for storage later. The "later use for storage" mentality is the reason why many people's storage spaces are not sufficient, as these empty boxes and bottles occupy too much space, and they are almost always empty, and you will never use them to store anything! Still, some people keep the boxes of their appliances, as they plan to use them during their next move to protect those items, especially electronics such as rice cookers and televisions. Therefore, their storage spaces are filled with various appliance boxes and the foam inside. I also used to do the same, as I bought a good rice cooker, so I wanted it to be well-protected during the move.

However, I later found that our storage spaces were filled with these boxes, so I started to rationally consider this issue. Moving is not something we do frequently, but living is. I lost my daily needed storage space for the sake of an occasional event, making my life cluttered and uncomfortable.

Moreover, appliances like rice cookers, no matter how good they are or how much money was spent on them, do they really need excellent protection during moving? No, they don't. These appliance boxes protect them from being damaged during long-distance transportation for sales purposes. However, moving for an average person is a leisurely and careful process, and it is unlikely to damage items. I later found that I could protect these items by wrapping them in a kitchen towel and putting them in a large box with other kitchen utensils, which provided excellent protection during moving, eliminating the need for their original boxes.

Some people keep the boxes to prevent potential return situations, and I also had this need. However, many people forget about the boxes they put aside and unconsciously occupy more and more space. I usually keep the boxes for a few days, placing them in a conspicuous place, such as the kitchen entrance, so I can see them every time I enter the kitchen and not forget to throw them away. After a few days, I am confident that I like the item and do not want to return it, and I dispose of the box promptly. This way, all the storage space in my house is filled with useful items instead of empty containers.

### Buying many identical pairs of socks

People who buy many identical pairs of socks might do so for several reasons. Some may believe that having multiple pairs ensures they always have a clean pair available, while others may prefer the uniformity and coordination of matching socks. Additionally, buying in bulk can save money, as discounts are often given for larger quantities. However, it's important to consider the space required for storing these socks, especially if living space is limited. One possible solution is to rotate socks, wearing and washing one pair while keeping the others in storage. This approach allows for a smaller number of socks to be kept on hand while still ensuring a clean pair is always available. Alternatively, investing in a larger sock drawer or storage container can help accommodate the larger number of socks. Ultimately, the decision to buy many identical pairs of socks depends on personal preference, budget, and available storage space. I learned a little trick from someone, which is to buy many identical pairs of socks. In the past, my socks were bought here and there, resulting in various colors, styles, and lengths. Every time you wash socks, you need to pair them up and roll them up carefully.

However, if you buy many identical pairs of socks, you wear one pair each day and throw it into a specific "worn socks" bin. Since each pair of socks is worn only once, they won't smell. You can wash socks every two weeks or even a month. After washing socks, you don't need to fold and pair them up, just put them directly into a "clean socks" bin.

I also have a similar method for underwear and T-shirts. Folding numerous T-shirts after washing is an unpleasant task for me because my T-shirts don't wrinkle. I later discovered that I don't need to fold T-shirts at all. Buy a specific box for T-shirts, put them in there after washing, and grab them when needed.

Since I use baskets to store these small items, even though the baskets are messy inside, the entire room looks neat and tidy from the outside.

### On the study of cleaning supplies
[It's about a person's method of managing their socks, underwear, and T-shirts using baskets, allowing them to keep their living space tidy despite the mess inside the baskets.]otherwise, cleaning tools and methods are also important. Many people might think that someone like me, a "master," would not care about such trivial matters. However, I have researched household cleaning extensively, even consulting professional cleaning ladies. Below are some points I'd like to share. Since the secrets of cleaning are too numerous to cover here, I can't possibly go into detail.

First, I'd like to point out a common misconception among Chinese people: they divide their homes into "dirty areas" and "clean areas." Many people believe that the bathroom is dirty, wet, and the toilet seat is dirty, the balcony is dirty, while the bedroom is clean. They then complicate matters by requiring shoes to be changed when entering the bedroom from the living room or bathroom, or when going out onto the balcony. They wash mops in the bathroom, so there are several buckets, each labeled for different purposes: washing face, underwear, socks, feet, mop, father's feet... The location of these buckets is a serious problem.

Some areas in the home are considered "supposed to be dirty," such as the top of the refrigerator or the bottom of the toilet seat. Therefore, they are ignored. Household rules prohibit touching these areas, or they cover them with plastic paper or newspapers for convenience in cleaning. Soon, the entire house is covered with these paper-like trash, making the house uncomfortable and unpleasant. They think that if the plastic paper gets dirty, they will throw it away and replace it, but in reality, the plastic paper is covered in a thick layer of dust, which no one bothers about, making no difference from not having the plastic paper.

Instead of making the house so complicated and setting up various rules for family members to follow, it would be better to make all areas clean, so that you can wear one pair of slippers and walk anywhere, sit anywhere, and not fear accidentally touching dirt. All you need is a rechargeable handheld vacuum cleaner, and you won't have to worry about these dust issues.

Moreover, a house should not have mops or buckets for cleaning. A reasonably clean house should not have many dirty things, so there is no need for heavy cleaning equipment like mops. Consider buying a Swiffer-type floor sweeper instead, which uses disposable cloths. When the floor has a little dust, just lightly sweep it with the cloth, and when the cloth gets dirty, throw it away. No need to clean the cloth. I'd like to talk about dealing with dust. Many people like to use a damp cloth to wipe, only to find that the dust on the surface has turned into a muddy mess on the object. Many people believe that a damp cloth can prevent dust from flying, but they have not discovered that there are better ways to prevent dust from flying without turning it into mud.

I discovered this problem a long time ago and found that using a damp cloth was not effective. Instead, I started using a handheld vacuum cleaner to suck up the dust. This type of vacuum cleaner is effective in corners and crevices, but it is not ideal for larger items like a coffee table, as it leaves a lot of dust behind. However, items like a coffee table cannot be cleaned with a large floor vacuum cleaner. What should be done?

Later, a cleaning lady taught me a trick, which was Swiffer. Swiffer is a type of floor mop, which comes with two types of disposable cloths, one dry and one wet. The dry cloth can absorb dust and lift it up using static electricity, without pushing it around and making it fly. This cleaning lady's major discovery was that Swiffer's cloths could not only be installed on the floor mop to clean the floor, but could also be used directly in the hand to wipe objects.

Therefore, Swiffer cloths became the new generation of dusters, but unlike traditional feather dusters, they do not make dust fly. Most of the dust on furniture and objects was removed using Swiffer cloths, followed by a wipe with a damp kitchen paper towel, leaving it clean. Swiffer cloths can be discarded after use, saving a lot of effort.

In America, kitchen paper towels are very common, and they can be discarded after use. Many Chinese people are still using cloths to wipe things, and if they get dirty, they have to wash them. You need several cloths, some of which have been used to clean the bathroom, and you cannot use them to clean the kitchen. You have to remember which cloth is "dirty" and which is "clean".... Is it inconvenient? Kitchen paper towels are dense and do not leave lint, and they can even be wet and used again, making them a good alternative to cloths. I often clean things with kitchen paper towels, discarding them after cleaning a particular area. One exception, paper towels are used to wipe the kitchen countertops and stovetop, but they leave some residue no matter how hard you try, which is not noticeable on regular household items. Therefore, I usually don't use paper towels to wipe the countertops or stovetop, instead I use microfiber cloths. These microfiber cloths don't leave any traces, get dirty easily, and are easy to clean. Additionally, there are specialized glass cleaners (like Invisible Glass) that don't leave any traces.

Some people wipe down the kitchen countertops and cookware using dish soap on paper towels or cloths, thinking it makes them cleaner. However, dish soap is difficult to rinse off, and you need a lot of water to remove it, which is quite inconvenient.

The best solution is not to use dish soap, but rather use products like Lysol or Clorox, or cloths. Products like Lysol contain volatile ammonia, which has strong cleaning power, is non-toxic, and doesn't hurt the hands. After use, it evaporates on its own, so no water rinsing is required.

However, unless the surface has water-resistant dirt that cannot be removed with water, I usually don't use Lysol, as it does have a certain smell, and its disinfectant properties are not always necessary. So I usually just use water, and only use Lysol when water doesn't leave the surface clean.

In summary, there are many types of cleaning products and techniques, and I'm just providing some suggestions to spark your interest and encourage you to explore this field further. I won't go into more detail here, as specific questions require your own analysis and resolution.: The mentality of cleanliness among Chinese people

Many Chinese people have an irrational obsession with cleanliness, or what they call a "health obsession." They always feel that the outside world is dirty, so if they have sat on a chair outside, they cannot sit on it again at home, be it on the bed or the sofa. If you have gone to the hospital and sat there, you must come home and take off your pants to wash them, absolutely not allowed to touch anything at home, for fear that the chair you sat on was used by a skin disease or a sexually transmitted disease patient!

Some people believe that the washing machine used for outer clothes cannot be used for inner clothes, as outer clothes are considered dirty, and inner clothes should be very clean. Some even bought a "baby-sized washing machine" specifically for washing underwear. If they don't have this washing machine, their homes will have separate washing basins for different items: for socks, for underwear, and so on.

All these are unscientific conclusions. These people seem not to understand how bacteria live and spread, and blindly believe that pants sat on outside will have harmful bacteria to the body.

I must admit I'm impressed by the rational thinking of Americans. I once asked several Americans, how do you wash your shoes? They all found my question strange: "What? Just put them in the washing machine?" This is something many Chinese people find hard to believe. They will tell you it's because America is very clean, so they can do that. still not the case, Americans can wear those shoes anywhere, those shoes might have been to China, to Africa, stepped in dirty toilets...... Back in America, they forgot about these things and threw the shoes in the washing machine.... Ha ha, disgusting, right?

However, the facts are that no one has ever gotten sick from this, because bacteria cannot propagate in such a way. The bacteria sticking to the shoes require nutrition and water to survive, and even if there is a sticky substance on the shoes that they can survive in, it will dry out after a while. No matter what, the shoes went into the washing machine, and the washing machine liquid will kill the bacteria. All the dust and the like will be rinsed away into the sewage.

I have personally tried washing shoes in a washing machine, and of course, the shoes should be washed separately. It's best to throw in some old rags with the shoes to help scrub them. Pour in washing machine liquid, start the washing machine, and that's it. After washing, check the washing machine tub, there's nothing left in it. Later, when you wash clothes, underwear, there's no problem.

If you're not confident, you can buy a special washing machine cleaning agent, put it in after this, and start the self-cleaning program. In short, excessive concern for hygiene and health seems to be a common problem among Chinese people, and a reason for their complicated lives. There aren't that many disease-causing bacteria in the world, you need to understand their survival and propagation methods, rather than blindly believing they can stick to anything.

### Cleaning frequently touched objects

In short, excessive concern for hygiene and health seems to be a common problem among Chinese people, and a reason for their complicated lives. There aren't that many disease-causing bacteria in the world, you need to understand their survival and propagation methods, rather than blindly believing they can stick to anything.

To clean frequently touched objects:

1. Wipe down surfaces with disinfectant wipes or a solution of one part bleach to nine parts water.
2. Use a microfiber cloth to avoid spreading germs.
3. Clean high-touch areas like doorknobs, light switches, and remote controls daily.
4. Use disposable wipes for electronics, or use a microfiber cloth and rub alcohol.
5. Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
6. Consider using a disinfectant spray for carpets and upholstery.
7. Regularly clean and disinfect kitchen and bathroom surfaces.
8. Use a disinfectant spray for shopping cart handles and other public surfaces.
9. Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth.
10. Consider using a UV-C light wand to disinfect smaller, hard-to-reach areas.ally many Chinese people have obsessive-compulsive tendencies, feeling that everything is dirty, making life unnecessarily complicated, yet they often overlook some "hidden spots" for cleaning. These places are frequently touched with hands but neglected. Interestingly, people with obsessive-compulsive tendencies deal with them by avoiding them instead of cleaning them. Neglect of these spots leads to their constant discontent, yet they are often overlooked.

Below are some such objects:

1. Light switches, power outlets. I've noticed that many Chinese families' light switches and power outlets have a thick layer of dirt or grease. They clean other areas but neglect these two things. However, upon simple observation, you'll find that light switches and power outlets are the most frequently touched devices in your life. Every day, you touch the light switch numerous times, feeling that sticky sensation, do you find that comfortable? This uncomfortable feeling, subconsciously, triggers subtle emotional changes, so you can't relax and feel at ease. I discovered this issue, so whenever I notice a dirty light switch, I carefully wipe it clean with a disinfectant wipe. This not only brings joy to your hands but also benefits your eyes.

2. Wires, charging cables. The power cords of appliances and mobile phone charging cables are similar items. If they have a lot of dirt on them, they feel uncomfortable to hold. Particularly with mobile phone charging cables, which are often handled, so pay attention to their cleanliness. Due to the silicone coating on the iPhone's charging cable, it easily gets dirty, even when new, it feels sticky. I usually don't use the iPhone's original charging cable. Instead, I recommend Amazon Basics or Belkin brands.

3. Keyboards, mice. Many people's computer keyboards and mice have a lot of dirt, often overlooked during cleaning. However, if you pause and observe, you'll find that dirty keyboards and mice are in constant contact with your hands. Although there is no health risk, it brings a lot of discomfort. Just like people need to trim their nails, spending a little time to wipe down the keyboard and mouse will significantly improve your mood. Old-fashioned washbasins

In the past ten years of my life, I have discovered that there is an item that has disappeared from my life: washbasins, such as basins for washing faces, feet, or clothes. However, I have found that many Chinese households still have basins. I was puzzled as to why I once needed them, and why I no longer do.

Later, I discovered that the reason why basins had disappeared from my life was closely related to the advent of water heaters. In the past, people did not have gas water heaters, so they had to mix cold water and hot water in a basin to wash their faces. First, they would fill the basin with cold water, then add hot water from a thermos flask, and finally soak a washcloth in it and wring it out to wash their faces.

The advent of gas water heaters changed the situation. Since the water tap releases water that can be directly heated, many people began to use their hands to scoop hot water directly from the tap to wash their faces, instead of using a container to hold the hot water. Washing your face with running water is not only more hygienic but also eliminates the need for a basin for this purpose.

However, many elderly people do not understand this and, when they see a "washbasin" in modern homes, they still think it is used to hold hot water in it and then put a washcloth in it to wash their faces. These people find the washbasin dirty and do not know how to use it, so they continue to buy plastic washbasins to use instead. However, they find that the shape of the washbasin is not convenient for them, and they are not used to it. In fact, they are simply not familiar with its usage. if you understand the principle of a hot water heater and a sink for washing face, you will find that this so-called "washing basin" is not used to hold washing face water at all. It is only used to collect the dirty water from washing your face and brushing your teeth. Therefore, it doesn't need to be particularly clean, and multiple people can share this kind of pool without any problems.

Similarly, brushing teeth doesn't necessarily require a cup. Since the faucet is right in front of you, you can scoop a little water in your hand to brush your teeth. So I chose a beautiful cup to put my toothbrush in, but I never use it to fill water. Moreover, I found that some people like to put toothpaste in the cup, but since toothpaste is quite thick and heavy, it makes it inconvenient to take it out, and sometimes the cup tips over because of the unstable center of gravity. In fact, toothpaste can be placed on the countertop, and only the toothbrush needs to be put in the cup, because it gets wet.

At home, I only have one kind of basin, which is a "foot bath basin." I found that a sink and a bathtub cannot achieve the same effect, so I bought one. Fill it up with a tub of hot water, add some relaxing bath salts, put it on a beautiful mat and towel, put your feet in it, and have a cat companion beside you, it is a truly indulgent enjoyment :)

Washing dishes is the most hated chore in the world. A common phenomenon in many Chinese families is that after eating, someone must immediately go and wash the dishes. This is not good, after enjoying the food, you should relax and enjoy some tea and chat with your family. However, instead, after eating, everyone is thinking about who should wash the dishes, and one person goes to the kitchen to wash the dishes, preventing family communication. Everyone doesn't want to wash, and it becomes even more troublesome and even hurt feelings. I. For this issue, my solution is that everyone rests after eating, no need to wash dishes. If there's a need to clear the table for tea, just throw all the dishes into the dishwasher pool, then start resting. Think about it, what's the rush to wash dishes for? There's no benefit.

II. Another better solution is using a dishwasher. I believe a dishwasher is one of the greatest inventions in the world. A dishwasher is a standard appliance in American houses, yet many Chinese people in America use it as a cabinet, never turning it on. They think dishwashers consume a lot of water and electricity, so they can't afford it. This is a misunderstanding. If you observe the structure of a dishwasher, you will find it doesn't use much water. Its principle is to use a large vortex to spray out a small amount of water at high speed, with a detergent containing powerful cleaning agents, achieving the cleaning goal. Consequently, it doesn't use up much water, definitely less than bathing water, and it doesn't consume much electricity either.

III. I have tried this, and found that my water and electricity bills didn't increase significantly after using a dishwasher. The detergent for dishwashers is not expensive. I have seen someone try to save money by cutting open the small package of detergent into two parts to use, only to have the liquid leak out and hurt their hands. A few cents' worth of thing, why be so stingy about it :P

IV. A bachelor usually eats a little at home, doesn't have many dishes, isn't it a waste to put a few dishes into the dishwasher? I have a tip for you. When I was a bachelor, I also had this thought, but later I found a trick. It's to buy a lot of dishes, plates, forks, and spoons, just like having a big family. I bought at least ten sets of tableware for myself, the purpose being to use this dishwasher. You take out clean dishes and tableware each time you eat, then throw them into the dishwasher after eating, but don't turn on the dishwasher, wait until it's full or after a few days. Once the dishwasher is full or after a few days, you turn on the dishwasher... Understood?

[V. Driving]

(Note: The last part of the text is unrelated to the topic and seems to be an unintended addition.) I've talked about household matters enough, now let's discuss going out. Many Chinese people are anxious when driving and like to tailgate, afraid that a car will cut in from the side. Even in America, they have the same mindset. If someone cuts in front of me from the side, won't I just slow down? So I follow closely behind the car in front, preventing them from cutting in.

Such people have not carefully analyzed the problem:

- What is the probability that someone will cut into your lane from the side?
- For each car that cuts in, how much time will it add to your arrival time?
- Do you care about that amount of time?1. After carefully analyzing and observing, I found that even if you maintain a long distance from the car in front, allowing someone to cut in front of you wouldn't significantly slow you down. Since the car is already fast, not many people would try to cut in front of you, not everyone is as anxious as you!

2. Moreover, there's a problem with following too closely: if the car in front brakes, you have to brake as well. Over time, your nerves would be completely controlled by the driver in front, and you'd have to react quickly to prevent a collision. You can certainly stay alert and avoid collisions, but if you maintain a larger following distance, you won't have to be so tense. You'll have more reaction time, and you can enjoy driving your car freely, not influenced by others.

3. Various stickers
I often see people with a phone covered in a worn-out sticker. Some people's stickers have become too hard, affecting the touchscreen's responsiveness. After some persuasion, I convinced some of them to remove the sticker. Once they did, they discovered that the screen was so beautiful and bright, and the touch response was so smooth! Then they regretted why they had been using a phone that was much worse than the current one for so long.

4. I'm deeply moved by people's care for their phone screens. If they cared for their bodies as much as they did for their screens, how wonderful that would be! I asked them how to remove the screen protector from their phones? I told them that my first smartphone also had a screen protector. When it was time to buy a new phone, I took off its protector, then used a key and a knife to scratch it hard for half an hour. To my surprise, the screen was undamaged and had no scratches at all.

Through a simple experiment, you can believe that the glass on a phone screen is so hard and not afraid of keys or other hard objects scratching it. The phone I used for the experiment was from 2008, and now the glass on phone screens has been updated several times, so it's definitely less susceptible to scratches. Therefore, putting a screen protector on a phone is unnecessary, as it prevents you from fully enjoying the expensive item.

There's also a common type of "protector" - a piece of rubber or glass placed on a wooden table. Many people bought an expensive wooden table and felt the price was high, so they bought a protective cover for it. Later, they found that the cover was also expensive, so they bought several small covers to protect the big one. Eventually, you find that you're not using a luxurious wooden dining table, but a rubber or glass one. You spent several thousand dollars, but ended up buying a rubber or glass table!

In fact, a solid wood table doesn't need protection at all, it's very durable. Wood gives people a warm and comfortable feeling, but covering it with a protective layer completely eliminates this feeling. If there were no protective layer, normal wear and tear is unavoidable, but the charm of the table wouldn't change. These small scratches even add to the charm of the wooden table, don't they? I've seen shops selling these wooden tables with scratches and burn marks, and even tree knots. They're very expensive because they have character.

However, on this type of table, it's nice to place a beautiful tablecloth on the eating area, so the utensils don't make a clattering sound when you eat, making the experience more comfortable and cozy.1. The same logic, you shouldn't put various remote controls into protective cases. It affects your feeling of using the remote control, sometimes the buttons become unclear, but it doesn't make the remote control last longer. In fact, the life span of appliances is much shorter than that of remote controls. When appliances are replaced, remote controls are often still in good condition. And how much does "universal remote control" cost online?

2. When I bought a car, the car dealer recommended a kind of "leather protection coating" to me, saying that after spraying it on, a protective film would form on the leather surface, making the seat waterproof and resistant to dirt. I refused this sales pitch, joking, "I want to sit on leather, not on some unknown chemical material coating :)"

3. This is the same logic: I bought a car with a leather seat, I want to enjoy it, not damage my comfort to protect it. The items we buy are for people's use, not for preservation. Later, this car ran for several years, and the seat was still like new, which proves that these so-called leather seat protection coatings are unnecessary.

4. However, the same logic doesn't apply to iPhones. An iPhone's original case is too slippery and round, so without a case, it is inevitable that it will fall to the ground! Therefore, you have to buy an iPhone case.

5. Shoveling shit tip:

This is a metaphorical expression, meaning that some things are not worth the effort or resources to protect or preserve, and it's better to enjoy them and let them naturally wear out over time. In this context, the Chinese text uses the example of remote controls and leather seats in cars, suggesting that it's not necessary to spend resources on protecting them, as they will likely still be in good condition when the appliances they control are replaced. The expression "shoveling shit" is a colloquialism meaning to do something unnecessary or fruitless, and in this context, it refers to the idea of spending time, money, or resources on protecting or preserving things that don't really need it. The expression "tip" in the title is likely a play on words, as it can also mean a piece of advice or information. So, the title "铲屎倌的秘诀" (chǎn chén zhēng mìmi) can be translated as "The Secret of Shoveling Shit" or "The Tip for Shoveling Shit." I have a cat and I'm quite wise about cat ownership, keeping him well-managed with no unpleasant smells at home. I'd like to share a secret here - I used Litter Genie.

It's an unassuming plastic box specifically designed for cat waste. Its unique feature is excellent isolation, making the smell disappear once the cat waste is inside. You can scoop the waste daily and leave it for weeks before disposing without any issues.

At first, my friends introduced it to me casually, and I thought, "I just put the litter in a garbage bag and throw it away right away?" But after using Litter Genie for several months, I realized how inconvenient it was without it, as I had grown accustomed to the simplicity: scoop, cover, done.

My cat-owning experience could fill a book, but due to space constraints, I'll keep it brief for now :P

### Summary
I have a cat and am experienced in cat ownership. I keep my cat well-managed with minimal smells at home. I use Litter Genie, a plastic box designed for cat waste, which effectively isolates the smell. I scoop the waste daily and can leave it for weeks before disposing without any issues. Initially, I thought disposing of the litter daily was sufficient, but using Litter Genie for several months made me realize its convenience. The simplicity of scooping, covering, and disposing made my life easier. My cat-owning experience could potentially fill a book. I've written so much, I'm getting a bit confused myself and lack coherence. There's more to life's wisdom than what I've discussed here, so I'm just dropping some pearls of wisdom, hoping to help everyone pursue a quality life. If you have any life hacks that many people don't know about, please feel free to message me and share.
