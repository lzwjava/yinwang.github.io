title: "Markdown issues"
---


I converted most of my previous blog post into markdown format. I found that although markdown looks clearer in the editor than HTML, it also has some drawbacks.

These markup languages' formats are similar to the "standardized exam marking language" I made for my dad when I was in college (he was a high school English teacher). I wrote a 1000-line Perl script to convert this simple marking language into beautiful LaTeX format documents with a friendly Tk graphical user interface. Looking back, my design was quite advanced at the time. Compared to my language, these blog markup languages are like a small witch seeing a big witch, and they have many problems. I'll get back on topic and discuss markdown's issues instead.

- Markdown actually uses a layout syntax similar to Python and Haskell. I mentioned the problems with layout syntax in a English blog post. Since the number of spaces determines the document structure, this format is quite brittle. A minor lack of spaces can result in unpredictable outcomes, especially in code blocks inside "itemize". Since each item brings indentation, the internal code must be indented by 4 more spaces than the item to be in the correct position. For example, I encountered this issue multiple times when converting blog posts: the problem is that the first line of the code "helloworld z = let x = 1" was indented incorrectly and ended up outside the code block. However, the effort required for accurate indentation is more than just using <pre> tags directly.

- Irrational use of special characters
Markdown's use of special characters is not very rational. I have encountered several instances where an entire paragraph turned into italics because the original document contained expressions like x*y. In the programming world, "multiplication" is much more frequent than "emphasis". Using * for emphasis actually uses a very infrequent character for this purpose. I have limited expressive ability in many details, markdown cannot express the format I want properly. For instance, it cannot insert line breaks correctly. If you have two blocks of code that are right next to each other but you don't want them combined, markdown insists on combining them.... So I found myself adding more and more HTML. This is more apparent in image syntax. Markdown introduced the format ![alt](image url), which is actually less visually appealing and inconsistent compared to HTML. For example, it still cannot express the size of an image, which is quite important information. Therefore, I feel that markdown's syntax has revealed its weaknesses, and if it is to express more complex information, it will become even more difficult to remember and less visually appealing than HTML. So for images, I think it's better to just use HTML's <img> directly.

In summary, markdown introduced too much "syntax," making it less direct for expressing slightly complex information compared to HTML. I'll make do for now. Maybe I'll design my own format later.
