I've mentioned Lisp several times in my previous blog posts, highlighting its advantages over other languages and the merits of Lisp Machines compared to Unix. Some have inquired about learning Lisp, while others have questioned why Lisp Machines didn't gain popularity. I sensed a mix of reverence and curiosity in their words, but also a hint of doubt.

This feeling was complex, as if I were peddling atomic energy toys among primitive tribes, only to be regarded as an otherworldly missionary. Reverence and submission didn't appeal to me, nor did skepticism and mockery. When I heard someone say, "Don't listen to him misleading the crowd, study those languages if you want to find work," I felt neither anger nor contempt. I merely smiled and shook my head, muttering to myself, "pitiful and laughable people."

People often misunderstand me when I discuss the merits of one thing over another. Now, some believe I'm advocating for Lisp, even going so far as to label me as "one of the three major Chinese Lisp fanatics." They seem to think that my recommendation implies they should abandon what they already have and embrace Lisp wholeheartedly. Conversely, those who support the other thing often harbor hostile feelings.

Many fail to understand that every thing has its good and bad aspects. I only highlight the good aspects of Lisp, keeping the bad ones in mind but yet to be addressed. These people seem to have anthropomorphized "things." Some say, "to love someone is to love them entirely," but this is a helpless statement because you cannot dissect a person into what you like and dislike and then reassemble them into your ideal lover. Things, however, are different. Since they are human-made, you can disassemble them and pick out what you like. I can clearly tell you that I don't advocate for Lisp, I'm not a Lisp fanatic, it's just one of my trinkets. This clever trinket contains many advantages that other things lack. People say forgetting history is equivalent to destroying the future. If Java hadn't learned "garbage collection" from Lisp, C# hadn't learned lambda, we might still be troubled by segfaults and continue to use unnecessary design patterns. You'll find that today's popular JavaScript is just an "imperfectly implemented Scheme." Lisp's essence is seeping into more and more common languages.

Many people don't have the ability to design programming languages, so they treat them and operating systems as unchangeable entities above them. In contrast, my training gave me the ability to design and implement almost any language. I know their strengths and weaknesses, I can disassemble and reassemble them. I can change the parts I don't like or add necessary features. When I talk about something being better than another, some people think I'm "complaining," asking, "Why then is this good thing defeated?" They don't understand, I'm just "analyzing." I want to extract the good parts from each thing and find a way to inject them into a new thing. I also want to learn from past mistakes to avoid repeating them.

So, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about having more people use Lisp, Haskell, or any other language. I won't, and I don't have the time or energy to share my secrets. I have no responsibility, and I don't have the power to save the world. This is a feeling of discovering a great treasure, I'm resting and recuperating on a pile of wealth. Even if I weren't here, the sun would rise tomorrow. Why should I be so eager to let others know how to enter this treasure trove? I'm not a selfish person, but I don't need to sell anything. This is like me introducing my "weight loss success experience," and you find it too difficult, you want to buy those miracle weight loss pills instead. I have no motivation to convince you. After all, it's not my fat.

Advocating for something, being fanatical about something, these emotions have existed in me. They may have brought me some benefits, helping me learn quickly. But the existence of these emotions also shows a person's weakness. When a person can't control something, they develop a "worship" mentality towards it, just like all religions and superstitions. When people are under the threat of natural disasters and can't control their own destiny, they develop a worship mentality towards gods and supernatural powers. This is a spiritual comfort, at least there's a god or Guan Yin Bodhisattva to listen to their hearts, to give them the courage to endure the disaster. But it also shows their helplessness and humility. This helplessness and humility can lead to fanatical religious mentality, because they fear their "protecting god" being overwhelmed by others' "protecting gods," making them subject to others. This is a foolish and servile emotion.

But when you have a powerful strength, you no longer need to fear, this worship, and the fanaticism caused by worship, gradually fade away. It's like a person with absolute martial arts power, he doesn't need to let everyone believe he's a master. Because he knows, in his banter, he can make opponents crumble to dust. So, he is self-satisfied, and indifferent to any feelings expressed by others. I. Introduction
