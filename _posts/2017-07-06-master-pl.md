title: "How to master all programming languages"
---


Yes, I'm not going to talk about mastering one programming language here, but all of them....

Many programming beginners are still writing me letters asking what language they should learn and how. Since I know how to master "all" programming languages, I always felt that the question of which language to learn was too basic, so I never got back to them :P But gradually, I found that it's not just beginners who have this question, even many senior engineers in big American companies don't really understand.

Today I have the motivation to finally answer this long-postponed "beginner question". Similar topics seem to have been written about before, but I want to rewrite it again. Because after communicating with many people, I have a clearer expression of the thoughts in my head that were not yet language.

If you have the following doubts, this article might be helpful to you: 1. You are a beginner in programming and don't know which programming language to choose to get started.

2. You are an experienced programmer or team leader, feeling confused about the various new languages emerging, unsure which one to "invest" in.

3. Your team argues endlessly about which programming language to use, causing various religious wars.

4. You adopted a fashionable language, only to find yourself mired in a quagmire two months later, suffering in agony....

Although I no longer ask such trivial questions, the undeniable fact is that programming languages remain an important topic, a situation that is unlikely to change in the short term. Programming positions often require familiarity with certain languages, and some companies even demand that you "deeply understand OOP or FP design patterns." For employed programmers, programming languages are still a contentious religious topic. Its religious fervor is such that when I criticize or mock certain languages (such as Go), some people reflexively assume I am a fan of another language (such as Java). I cannot be a fan of any language, not even Yin language ;) I can directly use any language I haven't seen before, without going through a learning process. After reading this article, you might understand why I can achieve such results. Every programmer should be able to do the same, I hope so.

Respect language features, not the language itself

Many people care whether they or others "speak" a certain language, they worship the inventors of various languages, and argue fiercely about which language is better or worse. These issues don't matter to me. Although I have criticized many defects of languages in my articles, in actual work I rarely argue about these with people. If there are people arguing around me, I even put on headphones and don't bother to listen to them ;) Why? I found the root cause is that I value "language features" rather than the entire "language." I can write decent code in any language, even the most terrible language makes little difference.

Any "language" is a combination of various "language features." Let me give an analogy: a programming language is like a computer. Its label might be "Lenovo," or "IBM," or "Dell," or "Apple." So, can you say that an Apple is definitely better than an IBM? You cannot. You need to look at what kind of processor it has, how many cores, what is the clock frequency, how much L1 cache, L2 cache, memory, and hard disk it has, the resolution of the display, the GPU of the graphics card, the network card speed, and so on, various "configurations."

These configurations correspond to "language features" in programming languages. Here are some examples of language features:: Variable definition

- Arithmetic operation

- for loop statement, while loop statement

- Function definition, Function call

- Recursion1. Static type system
2. Type inference
3. Lambda function
4. Object-oriented
5. Garbage collection 1. Pointer arithmetic
2. goto statement

These language features are like choosing a computer. When choosing a computer, nobody says Dell is definitely the best. They only say that this model has an Intel i7 processor, which is better than i5, DDR3 memory is faster than DDR2 by this much, SSD is much faster than a disk, ATI's graphics card is garbage....

Programming languages are the same logic. For beginners, there is no need to worry about which language to learn first and which one to learn next. Someone once asked me this question and spent several weeks deciding, but they didn't even start learning any language. The time spent on this decision could have been used to master all the languages they were considering.

Beginners often don't understand that every language has a "common" set of features. For example, variables, functions, integer and floating-point number operations, etc. These are necessary for any general-purpose programming language. Once you learn these features through "some language," you can easily apply this knowledge to any other language. The time you invest in this will not be wasted. So, beginners worrying about "which language to learn first," this time investment is not worth it. Instead, just pick a language and jump in. if you cannot write good code in one language using its basic features, changing to another language won't help. You will write equally bad code. I often see people with Java code that is quite messy and terrible, yet they blame Java and eagerly want to use Go. These people don't understand that the ability to write good code lies in the person, not the language. If your thoughts are not clear and simple, you will express them as a mess in any language. If your Java code is terrible, then your Go language code will be just as terrible, if not worse.

Many beginners are unaware that an accomplished programmer, when starting to use a new programming language, does not usually look at the big manual or books of this language first, but rather has a problem to solve. With a problem in hand, they can quickly browse the language manual for two minutes to see what it looks like. Then, they directly take a piece of example code and start modifying and experimenting with it, trying to change it into what they want to solve. In this short process, they quickly master the language and express their thoughts with it.

During this process, they may ask questions such as:

- What is the "variable definition" syntax in this language, do I need to "declare types" or can I use "type inference"?
- What is its "type" syntax? Does it support "generics"? How is "generic variance" expressed?: This language's "function" is what, "function call" is what, can we use "default parameters"?,...

Noticed that?, The content inside each quote is a language feature (or concept). These features can exist in any language, although the syntax may be different, their essence is the same. For instance, some languages write parameter types before the variables, some write them after, some have a colon in between, and some don't.

These actual problems all come up naturally while writing practical code to solve real-life issues, not by poring over language manuals from the start. Because people who master language features know that they only need what's necessary, and there's always a way to express it in any language. If there's no direct way to express it, there's always some "workaround." If there's a direct way, it's just a matter of slightly different syntax. So, they look for features with specific problems, like looking up words in a dictionary, rather than being overwhelmed by the manual and taking a month to start coding.

Mastering common language features leaves only language-specific features. Researchers in language design know that creating new, good, harmless features is incredibly difficult. So generally, a good language's unique new features won't exceed one or two. If a language claims to have more than 5 new features, be cautious, as they might not bring advantages but disasters!1. Scheme:
The same logic applies, the best language researchers are not usually the designers of a certain language, but the designers (or supporters) of key language features. For instance, the computer scientist Dijkstra was a strong supporter of recursion. Although most languages have recursion now, you might not know that early programming languages did not support recursion. It was only when Dijkstra strongly advocated for the Algol 60 committee to include support for recursion that this situation changed. Tony Hoare is also a language feature designer. He designed several important language features but did not design any language. Moreover, there was a language expert named Wang SC. He was an early supporter and implementer of union types, as well as a supporter of checked exceptions. In his own blog, he pointed out the relationship between checked exceptions and union types :P

Many people blindly worship language designers, and they become ecstatic when they hear that someone has designed (or even euphemistically called "invented") a language. However, they fail to understand that all programming languages are like Dell, Lenovo, Intel, AMD, ARM, and Qualcomm - they are just "assembly machines." Language feature designers are the creators of core technology, like Intel, AMD, ARM, and Qualcomm.

### Rational Beginner Languages

Therefore, beginners should start with a "reasonable" language that has no major issues to save time and effort. They should master the essential language features and then apply these concepts to other languages. So, which languages are reasonable for beginners? In my opinion, these languages are suitable for beginners:

- Scheme I would not recommend the following languages for beginners:

- C
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript

Instead, I would suggest considering languages with simpler syntax and more beginner-friendly resources, such as:

- Ruby
- Swift
- Python (for some, especially with the right resources)
- JavaScript (with a focus on modern frameworks like React or Angular)

Keep in mind that the best language for beginners can depend on individual learning styles and career goals.1. Shell
2. PowerShell
3. AWK (awk)
4. Perl
5. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor): In general, you shouldn't use so-called "scripting languages" as beginner languages, especially those derived from early Unix systems. PowerShell may have advanced from Unix Shells, but it still hasn't overcome the fundamental issues of scripting languages - their designers didn't know what they were doing :P

Using scripting languages to learn programming comes with a major issue: it makes learners miss out on the key concepts. Scripting languages often integrate system tool-like features (such as regular expressions, web concepts) into syntax, causing beginners to waste too much time on them while not understanding the fundamental concepts of programming: variables, functions, recursion, types...... I don't recommend Go for the same reasons, although Go is not considered a scripting language, its designers apparently don't know what they're doing. Learning Go to program, you cannot focus on the most essential and best language features. Regarding the issues with Go, you can refer to this article.

Similarly, I don't think Rust is suitable as a beginner language. Rust put too much effort into showcasing its "new features," yet these features are not the most crucial parts, and many have issues. Beginners focusing too early on these features not only won't learn the fundamental programming concepts but may also stray from the right path. Regarding Rust's problems, you can refer to this article.

Master the key language features and ignore the trivial ones.

To illustrate this point, I found that many programming training institutions and MOOCs for programming beginners often teach students how to use printf to print "Hello World!" right from the start. They then require students to remember the meanings of printf's various "format characters," asking them to implement complex format output printing, and even requiring printing to text files and reading them back.... I must admit, this kind of input/output operation is not actually a part of the language itself, and for those who have grasped the fundamental concepts of programming, it is insignificant. Some people have been taking Java courses for several weeks, and yet they are still given assignments filled with printf statements. Students write out hundreds of lines of printf, but they don't understand what variables and functions are, let alone how to use arithmetic statements or loop statements! That's why many beginners find programming so difficult; I can't even remember what %d, %f, and %.2f mean, let alone learn programming!

However, these "professors" at those mediocre universities have such brainwashing titles that their students (like my girlfriend) come to me asking for help, only to scold me for teaching useless things, and they can't even finish the printf assignments! Don't talk to me about for loops or functions... Can't we wait a few months until I'm familiar with the usage of printf before learning those things?

Therefore, once a programmer has been taught poorly by a mediocre teacher, they are essentially ruined. Even if they encounter a good teacher, it's difficult for them to be corrected.

This is an exaggerated example, but it illustrates the problem caused by superficial language features from the same perspective. Here are some examples of insignificant language features:

1. printf
2. getter and setter methods
3. Magic numbers
4. Global variables
5. Spaghetti code
6. Goto statements
7. Complex design patterns without a clear understanding of the underlying concepts.

These features do not contribute significantly to the development of a programmer's skills or understanding of programming concepts. Instead, they can lead to confusion, poor code quality, and a lack of depth in programming knowledge. It's essential to focus on the fundamental concepts of programming and learn the language features that support those concepts, rather than getting bogged down in superficial details.1. In C language, if a statement block contains only one statement, brackets can be omitted.

2. In Go language, identical function parameter types can be merged and written together, such as func foo(s string, x, y, z int, c bool) { ... }

3. Perl treats regular expressions as a special syntax within the language.

4. In JavaScript, semicolons at the end of statements can be omitted in certain situations.

5. Currying in Haskell and ML languages. I. Implementing Language Features Yourself

After learning various language features and being able to use them to write code, the next step is to implement them. Only by implementing various language features can you fully possess them and become their master. Otherwise, you will just be their user, being led by the nose by the designers of the language.

A master once said that the best way to fully understand a language is to implement it yourself, meaning writing your own interpreter to realize its semantics. However, this statement should be slightly modified: the best way to fully understand "a language feature" is to implement it yourself.

Note that I changed "language" to "language feature" here. You don't need to implement the entire language to achieve this goal, as we ultimately use language features. Once you have implemented a language feature yourself, you will understand its implementation methods and usage in any language.

For example, when learning SICP, everyone implements an object-oriented system using Scheme. The object-oriented system implemented in Scheme differs greatly from the syntax of languages like Java, C++, or Python. However, it can help you understand the concept of "object-oriented" in any of these OOP languages, and it can even help you understand the differences in various implementations of object-oriented concepts. I. Effects of this kind are not attainable by directly learning Object-Oriented (OOP) languages, as when studying Java, C++, Python, and the like, you are merely a user. However, by implementing an OO system yourself using Scheme, you become a creator.

II. Similar features include type inference, type checking, lazy evaluation, among others. I have implemented nearly all language features, so any language in front of me is no longer a sacred entity to be worshipped, but a toy that can be disassembled and reassembled at will.

III. Summary:

Language features, language features, language features, language features! Both beginners and experienced programmers should focus on language features rather than being fixated on the entire "language brand." Only then can we truly understand and master any language, enabling us to write high-quality code almost immediately upon picking it up.

This document outlines the procedures for handling customer complaints in our company. Our goal is to ensure that all customer complaints are resolved in a timely and effective manner.

II. Receiving Complaints

1. Customers can submit complaints through various channels, including phone, email, and in-person visits.
2. Complaints should be recorded in writing, including the customer's name, contact information, and a brief description of the issue.
3. Complaints should be acknowledged within 24 hours of receipt, and the customer should be informed of the next steps in the complaint resolution process.

III. Investigating Complaints

1. The complaint should be assigned to a designated employee or team for investigation.
2. The investigator should gather all relevant information, including customer records, product or service details, and any other documentation related to the complaint.
3. The investigator should communicate with the customer to understand the issue in more detail and provide updates on the investigation progress.

IV. Resolving Complaints

1. The goal is to resolve complaints as quickly as possible, ideally within 7 days of receipt.
2. If the complaint can be resolved through a simple solution, such as a refund or replacement, this should be offered to the customer.
3. If the complaint requires more complex resolution, such as a product recall or policy change, the customer should be kept informed of the progress and expected resolution timeline.

V. Follow-up

1. Once the complaint has been resolved, the customer should be contacted to confirm satisfaction and gather feedback for improvement.
2. All complaint records should be reviewed regularly to identify trends and areas for improvement in our products or services.
3. Employees involved in the complaint resolution process should receive feedback and training to improve their skills and effectiveness.
