title: "English learning experiences"

Recently, many people have asked about English learning, so I thought I'd share some of my experiences.

For technical personnel, my experience is that first, you must definitely focus on learning English. Then, you can read English technical books and documents. The difficulty of technical books is generally less than that of novels and literary works because they cater to people in non-English speaking countries, using simple words and syntax.

Many people (including myself) have no problem reading English technical materials, but reading novels is still a bit slow. Novels often have various elaborate syntax and words, which technical books do not have. Therefore, reading novels first may be overkill.

If you find technical books challenging, you might try 'The Design of Everyday Things' by Don Norman. This book about design principles has no significant technical difficulty, but the English is clear and easy to understand. You can use it to learn English while also learning design. I generally read silently. If you feel the need to speak out, then your reading ability is not yet developed. Silent reading is a direct conversion of "light => visual system => language system => semantics." If you speak out or silently "pronounce" in your mind, you add more steps: "light => visual system => auditory system => language system => semantics."

When communicating with foreigners, you'll often hear that you need to be able to read and write. But "speaking" can be practiced separately and doesn't need to be done while reading.

Understanding the syntax is important for any language's listening, speaking, reading, and writing. However, note that "understanding syntax" does not mean memorizing syntax books and rules by rote. In "Solving English Grammar Puzzles," I've already explained that most English grammar books are ineffective dogma and, in some cases, even incorrect. You only need to master the essential, practical parts.

English or any natural language's most essential parts are similar to programming languages. Sentences are the most crucial structures. Each sentence is a "function call." Verbs (predicates) are function names, and other content (subjects, objects, etc.) are parameters. Each part can also have modifiers, just like object properties. Understanding this can help you quickly analyze sentence structures rather than getting stuck on the literal level.

If you understand that a sentence is a function call, you'll know when to use a period. Many Chinese people have an unclear concept and boundary of a sentence. They should have used a period but instead use a comma, leaving you unsure where their sentence ends. If you cannot clearly distinguish sentences, you won't be able to understand the logic within them well.1. The human brain processes language with an implicit "parse" procedure, similar to a parser in programming languages. Train yourself in this parse ability. Using the understanding of sentence structure above, you can quickly analyze the "skeleton" of a sentence, then fill in the modifying parts. This way, you can understand long sentences.

2. It's best to spend some time specifically training this parse ability. Repeatedly read some English technical documents that interest you. They can be books or blogs. For example, you can practice with two paragraphs, decomposing each sentence according to the "function call" structure I proposed, drawing out function names, parameters, modifiers, constructing a "syntax tree". Repeatedly ponder the structure of the syntax tree, then go back and read these two paragraphs again until you can quickly visualize the "syntax tree" for each sentence.

3. Many people practice English reading and enjoy reading long articles, but the effect is not good. Because they haven't clarified each sentence, they just skimmed over it, and by the end, they still haven't improved their parse ability. Repeatedly read the same passage, carefully analyze your mistakes, correct them repeatedly. Just like deep learning, train the neural network parser in your brain through backpropagation, improve parse accuracy.

4. I'm not saying you have to always focus on the syntax tree. Once your brain's parser is trained to a proficient level, you won't need to intentionally think about it anymore. The English parser works quietly in the background. You think it doesn't exist, but it's just familiarized and automated.

5. Syntax and sentence structure are key, followed by vocabulary. If your vocabulary is sufficient to read technical documents, you can start. Occasionally encounter unfamiliar words, look them up in a dictionary, write them down in a notebook (don't use a phone). The next time you encounter the same word and don't recognize it, look at your notebook. You'll remember it after a few times.: If you really cannot remember, you can draw a simple sketch next to the word to express its meaning. Make it exaggerated and creative. The sketch does not need to be perfect, just put in effort to draw. The content of the drawing does not need to make sense, you can even split the word into unrelated or slightly resembling words and paint them. Do not use others' mnemonic methods, as using others' will not make you put in effort.

Handwriting words is a "labour-intensive" way, training your brain to "engrave" words into your memory. The so-called "easy" method of memorizing words, the results may not be good, as effort is a crucial reason for memory formation. Just like effort is the reason for building muscles in fitness, you cannot build muscles by lying down.

Not using a phone to memorize words is one reason. A phone is not always accessible. It may be locked, requiring several steps to access your word list, making it slow. The phone occasionally pops up messages, distracting you. Using a notebook is faster, as it is immediately available for reference.

Moreover, the choice of dictionary is important. My strongest recommendation is: always use an English-English dictionary, not an English-Chinese dictionary. Numerous experiences tell me that even with the best English-Chinese dictionary, it will significantly delay or mislead understanding of English words.

The explanations in an English-Chinese dictionary are usually several similar Chinese words. Many people find this easier, thinking that understanding these Chinese words will help, but they fail to grasp a principle: only English can accurately explain English. The explanations in an English-English dictionary are usually a single sentence, along with a lot of contextual information, rather than just a few similar words. This method accurately describes the meaning of the word.: The gap between English and Chinese is enormous, with many English meanings having no equivalent in Chinese. No matter how good an English-Chinese dictionary is, its meanings cannot be very accurate. Chinese doesn't have that meaning at all, so how can it be explained? It can only be approximated with similar words, but this leads to significant meaning differences. Therefore, using an English-Chinese dictionary can only roughly tell what the meaning is, but not truly understand English words.

Many people are worried about not understanding English-English dictionaries, but in fact, English-English dictionaries explain using basic vocabulary, so there's no need to worry about not understanding. Once you've learned the basics, you should start using English-English dictionaries.

I recommend the Oxford English Dictionary. Many people idolize America because it's developed, so they believe they must study American English and use the Webster's dictionary, which is compiled by American editors. However, my experience tells me that Webster's is far behind Oxford's. Not only are its meanings less accurate than Oxford's, it's less clear, and some words' parts of speech may be mislabeled. Webster's examples are mostly fragments, not complete sentences. The number of examples is small, and the quality is low. The layout is not as elegant as Oxford's.

Although America's economy and technology are advanced, the most orthodox and beautiful English is still from the UK.

I see comments saying that reading technical materials in Chinese is sufficient, but I feel that Chinese materials are very difficult to understand and are easily misled. Many Chinese content is translated, and the authors themselves don't fully understand it, often translating inaccurately.: Chinese has inherent weaknesses in describing technical details in texts. Many terms are written in Chinese, embedded in a sentence, making it hard to distinguish them from common words. Since Chinese characters don't have spaces between them, and technical terms look similar to common words, it's hard for the eyes to discern which are terms and which are common words.

That's why I always put "terms" in quotes when writing Chinese technical articles. Later, I found that quotes were not clear enough and could be confused with speech quotes, so I started using angled quotes for "terms". Few Chinese technical documents are written this way, making it look laborious. I don't like translating some English terms into Chinese, either. For instance, if you write "卫生宏" (weisheng macro), I would find it hard to understand it. But if you write "hygienic macro", it's clear that it's a term.

I think the Japanese are smart. They have two types of script: hiragana for common words and katakana for foreign words. This is a reasonable approach. I think writing Chinese technical documents could also adopt this approach and directly use English terms for all technical terms.

I've strayed off topic... I originally wanted to talk about English learning, but this also helps you write better Chinese.

Moreover, the quality and quantity of English technical resources are much greater than Chinese, and there are many valuable videos on the internet. Learning English well is therefore crucial. I hope everyone can improve their English proficiency and read more English literature. Done.
