title: "Reason and Proof"

### Proof

During my time at Cornell, I often encountered such problems. Professors would write long "theorem proofs" on the blackboard as soon as they entered the classroom, with all students earnestly taking notes below, even in small classes with only ten or so people. Some who wrote slowly had to bring small recording machines to record the entire lecture, or else borrow someone else's notes to copy.

Once a famous professor wrote, facing away from the students, on the blackboard for half a lecture, completing several boards of proofs, proving the strong normalization property (SN) of simply typed lambda calculus (STLC). He finished just in time for class to end, turned around and gasped for breath, asking: "Any questions?" No one spoke up, so he said: "Good! Class is dismissed!"

A few days later, I asked him, "You proved that STLC has this property, but why does it have this property? You didn't tell me that." He looked at me with a smirk: "Don't you understand? I said, 'You need to be very smart and put in a lot of effort to come up with such a proof.'" Two years later, I took another programming language theory course at Indiana with my previous advisor Amr Sabry as the professor. He never brought lecture notes to class, seemed unprepared, and taught in a carefree manner. Yet, he always managed to clarify the key issues of problems. One day, he started talking about the SN property of STLC. He said, "I don't want to write down this proof for you to copy, I'll just tell you roughly how to think about it." The abbreviation SN stands for "the program will surely terminate." All programs that terminate have a "feature value" that decreases as the program runs. Your task is to find out what the feature value is for STLC. Then he started drawing a diagram on the board....

After some time, I not only learned this "proof," but also understood why STLC has such a property.

### Proof vs. Reason

From the above story, as well as your personal experiences, you may have noticed that education often places undue emphasis on "proofs," while neglecting what is more essential than proofsâ€”the "reasons" behind them.Reason is often simpler and deeper than proof, but harder to discover. For a fact, there are usually many varied proofs, but the cause of the fact is often only one. If you only know the proof but not the reason, you are usually trapped in someone else's theories and cannot free yourself. You can prove that a thing has a certain property, but you cannot change it or add good properties to it, nor can you remove bad properties. You also cannot invent new theories. Those who can invent new things and theories have the ability not only to know "proof," but also to know "reason."

For example, the difference between proof and reason is like the difference between evidence of a crime and the cause of the crime. Evidence does not cause the crime. With evidence, you can help apprehend the criminal, but if you cannot find the cause of the crime, you cannot prevent the same criminal phenomenon from happening again.

This is similar to the ancient distinction between "knowing that" and "knowing why," or "knowing the fact" and "knowing the reason for the fact."
