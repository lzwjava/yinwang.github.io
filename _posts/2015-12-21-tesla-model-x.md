title: "Tesla Model X Door Design Issues"
---


Tesla's upcoming SUV (Model X) inherits the issues mentioned earlier from the Model S, such as the touchscreen and door handles, and creates new ones. The Model X features an unusual door design, making it look like a bird with spread wings:

This type of door opening seems to save space and is convenient for opening in narrow spaces. It also looks cool, resembling McLaren or Lamborghini. However, this design comes with several issues in my opinion:

### Safety concerns

Since the rear doors are fully controlled by motors, opening them without power is a complex process. In the event of a power loss, it is impossible to open the doors from outside the car. This means that if a car catches fire, emergency responders may not be able to quickly open the doors to help the occupants. if you're lucky and haven't been injured, with a clear mind, if your airbag and safety belt haven't hindered you, you must complete three complex tasks to escape Model X:

1. Lift the cover of the speaker grille on the car door

2. Operate a hidden mechanism

3. Then lift the door yourself

I'm speechless.... How do you lift the cover of the speaker grille? Do you need to be ready with a wrench and a hammer in the car? Where are the screws located? Keep in mind, the users are not Tesla's mechanics. This design is very unfavorable for car accident escape. If the power source is damaged, the people behind you may not be able to escape in a reasonable time.: Weather troubles in rain and snow

- When the car door lifts up, there's a large gap at the back of the car. During rain or snow, the precipitation rides along with the door opening, entering the car in large quantities.

- When the door lifts up, dirt and debris lodged in the door frame fall into the car. If there's snow on the roof, it falls in as well. Imagine driving on a snowy day, opening the rear door, only to have all the snow on the roof fall on the person behind you...

- In heavy snow, the rear door may be pressed shut and unable to open, or the electric motor may be overloaded and damaged.

- Due to the large gaps in the door, this design is more prone to leaking problems caused by worn-out seals.: The trouble with squatting cars

In low-ceilinged garages, you might bump into the ceiling. This is a practical issue since there is often ample space around garages but the ceilings are low. For instance, during my recent trips to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, I frequently encountered such garages:

Overall, opening the door in very narrow spaces is not a major issue. Do wealthy Model X buyers often park their cars in narrow gaps? Is it worth designing such an expensive car door for this uncommon application? Even if you can open the door, will you be able to squeeze out once you get out? If the space is really too narrow, you can ask the person behind you to get out first and then park in the spot.

Moreover, sliding doors can also solve this problem without the need for a costly mechanism to lift the car door.

If you know that the width of a Model X body is 81.6 inches, which is wider than vehicles like the Hummer H2, Cadillac Escalade, and Ford F-150, you will realize that the real problem is not the lack of space but the fact that the car is simply too wide. How many people are willing to drive such a wide car is a question.: Functionality issues

- The roof can no longer support shelves. Unclear where to attach items such as skis and kayaks. This reduces the value of Model X as a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV).

- The rear doors no longer accommodate personal belongings. This makes it inconvenient for rear passengers.

### Manufacturing and repair issues

- The door mechanism is very complex and prone to issues, making repairs difficult. Manufacturing is also challenging, causing even an experienced German equipment manufacturer, who supplies parts for Mercedes-Benz and General Motors, to fail to meet Tesla's requirements.

The Great Wall of China, also known as the Chinese Wall, is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line to protect the northern borders of China.

II. History
The construction of the Great Wall began as early as the 7th century BC when various Chinese states built walls for their own defense. The first emperor of unified China, Qin Shi Huang, connected these walls and extended them to the north to protect his new empire from invasions. The wall was further expanded and improved upon by subsequent dynasties.

III. Length and Height
The total length of the Great Wall is estimated to be around 21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles). The average height of the wall is 7.5 meters (24.6 feet), but it can reach up to 15 meters (49.2 feet) in some areas.

IV. Materials
The materials used to build the Great Wall varied depending on the location and the resources available. In mountainous areas, the wall was built using stone and brick, while in other areas, it was built using tamped earth and wood.

V. Defensive Structures
The Great Wall was not just a simple wall, but a complex system of defensive structures. These structures included watchtowers, fortresses, and beacon towers, which were used for communication and defense.

VI. Cultural Significance
The Great Wall of China is a symbol of Chinese civilization and a testament to the engineering prowess of ancient China. It is also a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

VII. Modern Conservation Efforts
Modern conservation efforts have focused on preserving the remaining sections of the Great Wall and restoring them to their original condition. These efforts have included the use of modern technology, such as 3D scanning and laser surveying, to help identify areas in need of repair.

VIII. Visiting the Great Wall
Visiting the Great Wall of China is a must-do experience for many travelers. There are several popular sections of the wall that are easily accessible from Beijing, including Badaling, Mutianyu, and Simatai. It is recommended to visit during the spring or autumn months for the most comfortable weather.

IX. Conclusion
The Great Wall of China is a remarkable feat of engineering and a testament to the rich history and culture of China. Its enduring legacy continues to inspire and captivate visitors from around the world.
