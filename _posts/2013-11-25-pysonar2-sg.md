Two weeks have passed since I arrived at Sourcegraph, and I can honestly say that every day here is exhilarating. This is a startup with genuine creative energy. Our development speed is remarkable, and every day brings new ideas or significant simplifications of previous approaches. I must admit that Quinn and Beyang are more tenacious than I am. I created PySonar but kept its code in the attic for years, failing to realize its full potential. Quinn and Beyang recognized its value and persistently built Sourcegraph.com, allowing PySonar to exert such a powerful effect, enabling worldwide Python code search, and benefiting countless programmers. Our goal, however, is not limited to Python. Sourcegraph currently supports Go, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. Ruby support is still in its infancy and requires improvement, while other languages are in development.

After two weeks of tireless work, PySonar2's code underwent significant improvements. I can confidently say that it now contains the world's most powerful static analysis technology. Today, PySonar2 officially integrates with Sourcegraph.com. You can now view the analysis results of open-source Python code by logging into the main Sourcegraph website.

PySonar2's type inference system can precisely analyze Python function parameter types without relying on type annotations. For instance, the five most common functions in the Flask framework, as shown in the following image, are difficult to determine their types using conventional methods. PySonar2, however, can identify their correct usage.

The most intriguing one is render_template. PySonar2 infers its type as an intersection type: This means, the first parameter "template\_name\_or\_list" can be of type str or [str] (a list containing str). If given str, it outputs?, (PySonar2 is unsure of what it will output), and if given [str], it outputs?.

Paying attention to the English meaning of this parameter "template name or list" makes it seem like PySonar2 can read English. However, PySonar2 doesn't understand English; it only understands Python. It determined the type of this parameter through the call relationships and the strong type inference in the code.

### Some tips for using Sourcegraph

To clarify, the given Chinese text describes how the first argument "template\_name\_or\_list" in the function call `templating.render_template` can be either a string (str) or a list of strings ([str]). If the argument is a string, the function call will output?, and if it is a list of strings, it will output?. PySonar2, a static analysis tool, uses code relationships and strong type inference to determine the type of this parameter.

The text also mentions some tips for using Sourcegraph, but the content of those tips is not provided in the text. Sourcegraph is an open-source code search and navigation engine for GitHub and other version control systems. It allows users to search and navigate code across multiple repositories, making it easier to understand the context and relationships between different parts of the codebase. Some common use cases for Sourcegraph include:

1. Finding references to a specific function or variable across multiple repositories.
2. Understanding the context of a code snippet by viewing it in the context of the surrounding code.
3. Navigating to the definition of a function or variable.
4. Searching for specific code patterns or regular expressions.
5. Collaborating with team members on code reviews and debugging.

To use Sourcegraph effectively, it's recommended to have a good understanding of the codebase and the programming language being used. Additionally, familiarity with regular expressions and the ability to use multiple search queries can help narrow down results and make the search process more efficient.1. To analyze a required GitHub repository for Sourcegraph:

Currently, this feature is limited to GitHub. If you cannot find your required GitHub repository on the Sourcegraph website, it doesn't mean you have to wait for us to initiate the analysis. You can do it yourself!

The method is simple: Remove the "http://" from your GitHub address and append it to "http://sourcegraph.com/". Sourcegraph will then display a waiting page and automatically initiate analysis of the repo.

For instance, if you wish to analyze the code at "http://github.com/myname/myrepo", input the address in your browser as:
[sourcegraph.com/myname/myrepo](http://sourcegraph.com/myname/myrepo) if Sourcegraph hasn't analyzed this repo yet, it will add it to the work queue, then you can do other things or browse other code. Once the analysis is complete, the browser will automatically redirect to the required codebase. A typical size codebase takes a few minutes to half an hour to process.

#### Using Sourcegraph badge in your GitHub README

You might have noticed that some people have Sourcegraph badges in their GitHub, allowing others to view some statistics about your codebase. For instance, my psydiff's README has this one:

It indicates the number of views for psydiff's code. You can also use other badges, such as most used functions, cross-references, users, etc.: To obtain these badges, it's simple, just click on the wrench-shaped icon as shown in the figure on your repo's Sourcegraph page, then copy the "Image URL" to your webpage:

Sourcegraph's functionality is quite powerful, but many design aspects are still in the initial stages. If you have any suggestions or find issues, please contact us: hi@sourcegraph.com.
