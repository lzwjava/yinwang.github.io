title: "Eliminate Problems"
---

1. Why is this problem existent?

2. Is this problem necessary?
3. Can this problem be eliminated or avoided?

Instead of focusing solely on solving problems, it's essential to consider their origins and whether they're worth addressing in the first place. Many problems are man-made and can be eliminated by changing our perspective or design. By developing the ability to "eradicate problems," we can save time, resources, and mental energy. It's a skill that's often overlooked but can be game-changing. 1. Is this problem really "existent"? You might have figured it out by now, many problems may not exist despite being believed to do so by everyone. One cannot blindly trust any person or institution, no matter how authoritative. Just like a small horse crossing a river, one can only rely on one's own practice.

2. What practical benefits would solving this problem bring to me and others? The world does not have "eternity" or "infinity." If a "fortune teller" takes 100 years to predict my future, I might as well wait for "future" to arrive. Everyone is just passing through this world. Therefore, the answer to the problem should be able to provide practical benefits within a reasonable time frame.

3. Is this problem solvable by merely changing some "designs" or "approaches"? Many problems seem "existent" due to human "mental set." They fail to see the root cause and causal relationship, instead assuming the existence of a "premise" (A) and then unwaveringly believing in the problem (B) derived from it, as shown in the diagram: A ---> B.

They then become fixated on solving B, completely forgetting to question the necessity of premise A. They never considered how to eliminate A or cut off its connection to B. They failed to realize that once this prerequisite A no longer exists, problem B can dissolve itself.

This reminds me of an interesting story. Someone presented a "riddle" to everyone at the table, asking them to stand their eggs upright on the table, leaving only one person who succeeded. That person cracked the eggshell. Everyone else assumed a rule was broken, but the real issue was with them, as the egg cracking was never forbidden. I frequently find that there is a problem in the field of computer science. After researching for several decades, it was discovered at the end that the problem solved with great effort contained incorrect assumptions. If we look at it from another angle or make slight design changes, this problem no longer exists. One example is the "syntax analysis" (parsing) problem in compilers.

The syntax analysis became a problem because many people mistakenly believed that programming languages should have complex syntax. It is these complex syntactical rules that caused this problem to be researched for many years without a good solution. However, once the syntax design is simplified (like in Lisp), syntax analysis becomes a very easy problem. In fact, many problems in computer systems (such as Unix) are caused by this, as they want to exchange data using strings but have designed some very inconvenient "data formats". Simple syntax design will make these problems disappear. Regarding this problem, I don't want to repeat myself, details please see another blog post "Talking about Syntax" (in Chinese).

Einstein said "imagination is more important than knowledge", perhaps this is the reason. People without imagination often dig themselves into a dead-end, forgetting that they actually have other paths to walk.
