title: "A isn't great, I suppose you mean B then?"
---


(For political enthusiasts, if A is capitalism, B is socialism; if A is America, B is China; for IT personnel, if A is Unix, B is Windows; if A is Vim, B is Emacs; if A is a relational database, B is a NoSQL database, etc.)

Then this person will firmly believe I'm a booster for B, leading to hostility. These conversations become more and more confusing, awkward, and make me feel diminished. I analyzed it carefully and found the root cause of this problem. It turns out that the reason is because my way of thinking is completely different from others. I always speak from a "creator" perspective, while they stand from a "user" perspective. With different heights, of course, there can be no communication, birds of a feather flock together.

The creator says "A is not that good," and his meaning is usually not that you should use something else. His meaning is actually that A is not good, I can remove its defects and "create" something better. The difference lies in "use" and "create." The user says "A is not good," it is helpless complaint; the creator says "A is not good," it is a joyful anticipation of improvement. Unfortunately, the user can never understand the creator's heart, the creator's joy is translated into complaint in the user's mind.

The creator has the ability that the user does not have, he can freely manufacture new things without the design constraints of existing things. The creator therefore has a higher sense of security, deeper foresight, and a broader mindset. He is not easily trapped in the "religious conflicts," he does not need to choose any "camp," because the solution to this conflict is simple for him: create a new religion, eliminate the conflicting parties.
