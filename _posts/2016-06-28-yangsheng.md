title: "Harm of Health Shows"
---


Domestically, various types of "health shows" are popular, especially among the elderly. For instance, my parents sometimes send me some health shows, such as 'Dangers of Drinking Cold Water'. This show states that a person had allergic rhinitis, constantly sneezing and sniffling, severely balding, half bald, weak and powerless, and declining sexual performance.... In the end, the expert concluded that it was due to him drinking a cup of cold water every morning!

From my observation, the theories in these health shows can be roughly divided into two categories: good and new. Unfortunately, the good theories are not new, and the new theories are not good.

### Good Theories

The first category of theories is to repackage familiar, time-tested common sense, such as brushing your teeth in the morning and evening, into "new theories". These theories are certainly not wrong, but they are common knowledge that everyone has been familiar with since childhood. Now, with the title of "expert", people come out and propagate these well-known common sense as the latest research findings, shocking the elderly. I encounter many such cases. Sometimes parents send me a message, saying "be careful about this or that habit, or else you'll get some kind of disease..." This was something I had known and taken care of since childhood, and I even remembered that my parents had taught me this long ago. Now, these "health experts" come along and manipulate us, making it seem like a new discovery, as if others don't know about it...

The power of "experts" is indeed formidable!

### New Theories

The second type of theory is to fabricate some "new theories," but they have not been scientifically verified. "The harm of drinking cold water" falls into this category. These theories attribute the cause of the problem to a specific small living habit (such as drinking a glass of cold water in the morning), while ignoring all other factors causing the problem. The problem with these theories is that they establish incorrect "causal relationships" through speculation.

As far as I know, allergic rhinitis, hair loss, and many other problems are mainly due to genetics and have little relationship with people's daily living habits. Now, there is someone who has allergic rhinitis and hair loss, and they happen to like to drink a glass of cold water in the morning. So, the expert comes to a ridiculous conclusion: drinking cold water caused their allergic rhinitis and hair loss. I. Expert opinions on health issues often link them to certain seemingly insignificant habits, creating sensational theories that cannot be verified. They can claim that your minor habit caused such serious health problems. This allows them to tell you what to eat and what not to eat, what to do and what not to do. Every now and then, these people come up with new theories, making you feel there is something new, but you don't notice the contradictions with their previous theories. Elderly people have poor memory, cannot discern the inconsistencies, and some people are willing to do anything for their health, as if living is just for constantly researching how to continue living... This is the key to the survival of these health experts and health programs.

II. Conclusions drawn from drinking cold water causing nasal congestion, hair loss, and bodily weakness, among other things, should first go through scientific experiments. You cannot base it on one person's case, as the data is insufficient, and it may be a mere coincidence, unable to establish a causal relationship. Therefore, experiments must involve two groups of people: one group drinks a cup of cold water in the morning, and the other does not. After a certain period, analyze the proportion of people in each group who experienced the aforementioned problems. If the group that drank cold water had a larger proportion of people with the problems, while the group that did not drink cold water had a smaller proportion, then you can conclude that "drinking cold water may cause nasal congestion and hair loss."

III. The experts in this program have not undergone experiments but instead quote (misuse) the various yin-yang theories from the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic. The idea that the Yang Qi rises in the morning, and drinking a cup of cold water extinguishes the Yang Qi, is clearly unscientific and irresponsible. In reality, this yin-yang theory is so ambiguous, similar to astrology, and you can use these sayings to explain almost any phenomenon in the world, whether good or bad. The same sentence can support two completely opposite results. Why is this possible? Because these sayings are inherently ambiguous, and different people interpret them from different angles, finding that they make sense.

IV. These health programs often attribute the causes of serious health issues to certain habits in daily life, such as what to eat and what not to eat, easily making people overlook the real causes and more serious factors. Elderly people who watch these programs often blindly believe that by sticking to or changing some small daily habits, they can avoid or correct serious health issues, delaying the discovery of scientific medical remedies. In this sense, health programs can be harmful. I recommend that elderly people watch fewer of these programs and learn more about scientific medical knowledge from real doctors.
