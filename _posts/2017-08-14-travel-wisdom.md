Every travel experience is a journey of self-improvement. Through each travel, I have discovered some ways to simplify life and make it more comfortable. With the help of 'Programming Wisdom' and 'Living Wisdom', I'm now at the airport, observing some travelers' gadgets and methods. Here are some travel tips I'd like to share, which might be helpful to others. Some secret techniques I cannot disclose, but there are still many things to share.

### Ditch the Hard-Shell Suitcase

During my recent trip home, I noticed that hard-shell suitcases were extremely popular, with some even having metal exteriors and bolts, resembling bomb boxes from movies. They have four wheels and the opening is from the middle rather than the top. I was puzzled as to why everyone was using these cases.

Firstly, during travel, there isn't much valuable stuff that requires such robust protection. You can simply put some items between your clothes to provide similar protection, and they won't get hurt even if they're bumped. If you do have expensive and fragile items, you can put them in a separate box first and then pack it in the suitcase. I have observed that many hard-shell boxes look good new, but once they get scratched by hard objects such as floors, stairs, or facilities on trains or planes, they leave unsightly and sharp scratches or dents. This feels uncomfortable to touch and is not pleasant. Many hard-shell boxes have smooth exteriors, but when they get dirty with dust, the dust sticks to your hands. Imagine carrying a box with scratches and dust all over it, putting it on a luggage rack...

Therefore, despite the popularity of hard-shell boxes, I only use soft fabric boxes. Soft fabric boxes have advantages such as not leaving dents or scratches when bumped, and the dust does not transfer to your hands. They are also comfortable to touch and give a comfortable feeling since the box is often close to your body. Soft fabric boxes usually have small pockets on the outside for storing small items.

The openings of hard boxes are usually in the middle, which seems more convenient for organizing items, but I have used a box with a middle-placed opening before, and it didn't live up to that expectation. During travel, items can be arranged in a somewhat orderly fashion and a small bag can be bought to store items like toothbrushes. There is no need for an opening in the middle, as lifting the box and carrying it feels heavy, and there is a fear of items falling out when opening it.

The password locks on luggage are mostly useless. Three-digit password locks may make you think that it would take someone 1000 attempts to open it, but the actual number of combinations is only 30. I can open this type of lock in half a minute. So, don't bother with password locks when buying a box.

The four wheels on the luggage are still good because the passages in planes and trains are relatively narrow, and carrying the box horizontally is not easy. In the narrow passages, lifting the box feels laborious, and if someone blocks your way, you have to put it down again... I'd suggest using a soft suitcase with four wheels instead.

### Bring your own toothbrush and flip-flops

Don't count on the hotel having a satisfactory toothbrush or flip-flops for you. Most hotel-provided flip-flops are disposable, and wearing them for a few days leaves a sticky feeling. Many people make do with this for a couple of days, but if you're staying longer, it's better to bring your own flip-flops.

I never use hotel-provided free toothbrushes. In fact, American hotels have never provided toothbrushes and toothpaste because these items could potentially harm your health if they're not up to par. American hotels are afraid of lawsuits, so they just don't provide these items for free. Such a small item is best to bring with you.

If you're staying longer, bring your own. I never use hotel-provided free toothbrushes because they could potentially harm your health. American hotels don't provide toothbrushes and toothpaste for this reason. Bring your own toothbrush. Don't go out without Crocs plastic shoes. I'd rather mention Crocs shoes...... Due to some historical reasons, I've always liked using Crocs clog-like shoes as slippers. I even brought them traveling with me. However, I later discovered that Crocs shoes take up a lot of space in the box, and they're not very practical.

You might think that these plastic shoes are comfortable in the rain or on the beach sand, but you're wrong. The reason is that the front of these shoes isn't completely open, so once sand or small pebbles get inside, they're hard to get out. Therefore, the sand and small pebbles stay in the shoes and torment your feet.

This time when I went out, I put my long-followed Crocs shoes in the box, taking up a big space. When I realized they had been helpless all along, I bought a pair of lightweight woven sandals from a street stall instead, and the Crocs shoes ended up in the hotel trash can :P

### Arrive early at the airport

I found that many people calculate their airport departure time too precisely, such as leaving two hours in advance, only to encounter traffic jams or find the security line very long, making them anxious and rushing around. I follow the practice of buying afternoon tickets instead of morning tickets, arriving at the airport earlier with an hour of leisure time. Airports generally have good facilities such as coffee shops, so it's not much different to loiter there instead of in the city.

This method has its benefits as your nerves remain relaxed and calm.

### Avoid queuing at the boarding gate

I don't understand why some people like to queue at the boarding gate before it's even announced for everyone to start boarding. One plane load of people, whether you board first or last, still takes off and lands together. Do you really think queuing up front will get you to your destination earlier? In my one and only experiment, that queue took around 40 minutes. That time, I felt really crazy and stupid.

Intelligent people sit near the boarding gate seats or in coffee shops instead. Once the announcement is made to start boarding, they leisurely walk to the boarding gate. Generally speaking, the people in front have to stop at the aisle to check in their luggage, so this long queue takes around 10-20 minutes to clear. If you hear the announcement, you still have to stand in line for 10-20 minutes. So even if you hear the announcement, you can still continue sitting and only walk over when the queue becomes significantly shorter, allowing you to board the plane directly.1. Point to note, some airports are quite long, so you'd better find the boarding gate location first and sit nearby. Don't rush to get off the plane only to find out you have to walk ten minutes to the gate!

### Be patient after landing

Most people will get up from their seats and leave as soon as the plane comes to a stop, pick up their luggage, and wait at the exit to get off the plane. In fact, it still takes a few minutes for the plane to come to a complete stop and for the aisles to be connected, and there are some unknown procedures that need to be completed before the cabin door is opened. So, even if you get off early, you will only be standing in the aisle among the crowd.

Intelligent people will remain seated until they see the queue starting to move, then get up and prepare to get off the plane. It is customary for passengers in the cabin to let those in front of them disembark first, so you have the right to stand in the aisle and block the way for those behind you to get their luggage and then get off, without causing any courtesy issues. If your luggage is placed behind your seat and the queue in front of you prevents you from retrieving it, you can wait until everyone has disembarked before getting off, and it won't make a difference.

### Hail a taxi on the road

[Note: The Chinese text does not directly relate to the English translation provided, as the Chinese text discusses airport procedures, while the English translation discusses hailing a taxi. The English translation is provided for completeness as it was included in the original Chinese text.] I found that many people love to use Didi to call a taxi, even if there is an empty taxi right in front of them, they still use Didi to call for a "fast taxi." In reality, this approach that solely relies on Didi is not the best.

Using apps like Didi to call a taxi involves a "finding people" cost. Drivers often don't know where you are, or they know you're at a certain intersection, but they don't know which corner you're at. It takes a long time to explain where you are and finally get in the car, often taking several minutes or even more.

In reality, hailing a taxi from the side of the road is more efficient and accurate. Once you see the car, you wave it down, it stops, and you get in directly. There's no need to find people, and the entire process only takes a few seconds.

### Back seat of a taxi

I found that there are still some people (although there are fewer and fewer of them) who prefer to sit in the front seat of a taxi or Didi car. This seems to come from an old-fashioned notion that the front seat is more comfortable or safer. Perhaps because cars were not very good a long time ago, the front seat was indeed more comfortable, while the back seat might be uneven and prone to carsickness. This old notion has been passed down to this day, even though the front and back seats of cars are now equally comfortable. The issue with the front seats is that the driver is right next to you, requiring you to share the front space with him. Every move you make is visible to him, including the messages on your phone. If you encounter an angry or unpleasant driver, you will be more easily influenced by him. Some cities install a partition glass next to the driver's seat to protect him. With this board in place, the space on the right side is greatly reduced, and the feeling is uncomfortable due to the glass in the way.


However, the best seats in a taxi are actually the back seats. Whether I'm traveling alone or with friends, I prefer the back seats. If there are two people, we both sit in the back seats, leaving the front seats empty. If there are three people, then someone has to sit in the front.


There is a etiquette issue here. If it's a friend's car, then the right side of the front seat must have someone accompanying. This is because a friend is not a service worker, so you cannot leave him alone in the front seat, making him seem like a driver. On the contrary, taxi drivers are indeed serving you, just like restaurant servers. So you sit in the back, leave the front seats empty, and this is not impolite behavior, but rather appropriate.
