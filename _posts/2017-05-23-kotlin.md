title: "I. Kotlin and Checked Exceptions"
---


Recently, JetBrains' Kotlin language has become a hot topic. Domestic editors are rumoring that Kotlin has replaced Java and become the "preferred language" for Android. Many people were excited after hearing this, and beginners started asking various "stupid questions," such as "Is it too late to start learning Kotlin now?" This led to some scorn from Kotlin veterans. Some people also requested my evaluation of Kotlin.

Regarding requests to evaluate languages, I generally ignore them. As a professional language researcher, it's not my responsibility to evaluate languages designed by others. However, after browsing Kotlin's documentation, I found that the Kotlin designers misunderstood an important issueâ€”whether checked exceptions are necessary. I've thought about this topic for a long time and believe it's worth sharing my perspective to prevent misunderstandings, so I've decided to write an article.

This article primarily targets checked exceptions rather than Kotlin, as this issue also exists in C# and other languages.

### Calm Down
II. The Concept of Checked Exceptions

Before diving into the discussion, let's clarify the concept of checked exceptions. In object-oriented programming languages, exceptions are used to handle unexpected conditions. Exceptions can be categorized into two types: checked and unchecked.

Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be explicitly handled in the code. The compiler forces developers to handle checked exceptions by throwing a CompileError if they are not. Checked exceptions are typically used for programming errors, such as dividing by zero or trying to access an out-of-bounds array index.

Unchecked exceptions, on the other hand, do not need to be explicitly handled. These exceptions are typically used for runtime errors, such as null pointer exceptions or I/O errors.

III. The Debate on Checked Exceptions

The debate on checked exceptions has been ongoing since their introduction in Java. Some developers argue that checked exceptions make the code more robust and easier to debug, as they force developers to handle potential errors explicitly. Others argue that checked exceptions add unnecessary complexity to the code and can lead to excessive boilerplate code.

IV. Kotlin's Approach to Exceptions

Kotlin takes a different approach to exceptions compared to Java. Kotlin does not require checked exceptions, but it still supports them. Instead, Kotlin uses unchecked exceptions for most cases. This approach allows developers to write cleaner and more concise code while still providing the flexibility to handle checked exceptions when necessary.

V. Conclusion

In conclusion, the debate on checked exceptions is not unique to Kotlin. This issue exists in various programming languages, including C#. While some developers argue that checked exceptions make the code more robust, others argue that they add unnecessary complexity. Kotlin's approach to exceptions strikes a balance between the two, allowing developers to choose when to use checked exceptions while still promoting cleaner and more concise code.

VI. References

For further reading on this topic, consider the following resources:

1. [Oracle's Java Tutorial on Exceptions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/)
2. [Microsoft's C# Documentation on Exceptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/language-specification-v3-0/statements.cs007)
3. [Kotlin's Documentation on Exceptions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/exceptions.html) Before entering the topic, I'd like to correct some misunderstandings first and calm down some people. Contrary to some domestic media rumors, Kotlin is not "replacing Java to become Android's official language." In fact, Kotlin only received "official support" from Android, meaning you can develop Android programs using Kotlin without bypassing many restrictions. Kotlin and Java are both official languages for Android, but Kotlin will not replace Java; they coexist.

I have to criticize some domestic tech media here. They seem to enjoy reporting in a partial and distorted way, blowing up ordinary events. If you look at how foreign media report on Kotlin, you'll find their language is quite different:

Google's Java-centric Android mobile development platform is adding the Kotlin language as an officially supported development language, and will include it in the Android Studio 3.0 IDE.

Translation: Google's Java-centric Android mobile development platform is adding Kotlin as an officially supported development language and will include it in the Android Studio 3.0 IDE.

Do you understand now? It's not "replacing Java," but just "adding another choice." I find that these tech editors in China seem to enjoy twisting "choice" into "replacement." Recently, these editors also spread rumors that "Stanford University changed the programming language for its introductory courses to JavaScript," but in fact, they only "added" a new course using JavaScript as the primary programming language, while the Java-centric introductory course did not disappear. I hope everyone will keep a clear mind when encountering such reports and distinguish "choice" from "replacement," and not blindly believe that one thing will immediately replace another. I cannot abandon Java for Kotlin in Android. Most existing Android code is written in Java, and most programmers are using Java. Many people know the advantages of Java, so they are unwilling to switch to a new, untested language. Although Kotlin has gained equal footing with Java in Android, getting programmers to switch from Java to Kotlin is not an easy task.

I don't understand why people cheer for every JVM language as if it will replace Java, as if they have some deep-seated hatred for Java. They've already gotten worked up over many new languages, haven't they? Scala, Clojure... It's like a peasant rebellion in ancient China, stirring up a mob to rebel, yet they don't even know what they're doing. Kotlin's website boasts "drastically reduce the amount of boilerplate code" as a major feature, implying that Java has a lot of "boilerplate code."

If you analyze rationally, you'll find that Java is not as hateful as some people make it out to be. In fact, quite the opposite. Some of Java's design may seem "complicated and redundant," but it was deliberately made that way. Those who don't understand a language's "usability" often mistakenly believe that brevity is good and that writing a few more characters makes it ugly and unrefined. Regarding Java's good design, you can refer to my previous article "Giving Java a Fair Shake." In my analysis of Rust, I also mentioned some misunderstood issues of language usability. I hope these articles are helpful to people, preventing them from discarding the good because of prejudice.

I discovered Kotlin a long time ago and read its documentation, but it didn't spark great interest in me at the time. Suddenly, it's become popular again, and I revisit its new documentation, but I still find myself continuing to use Java or C++. Although I think Kotlin is more elegant and consistent in some small ways compared to Java, I haven't found it exciting enough to make me want to abandon Java. In fact, Kotlin's minor improvements, I had thought of when designing my own language, but I don't think they are compelling reasons for people to switch to a new language.

### The Importance of Checked Exceptions (CE)

Checked Exceptions (CE) play a crucial role in Java's error handling mechanism. They are a part of Java's static type system, allowing the compiler to enforce exception handling at compile time. This enforces a contract between the method caller and callee that the method will either complete its execution or throw an exception. This contract helps to ensure that the application can recover from exceptions in a controlled manner and prevents the propagation of exceptions unchecked throughout the call stack.

In Java, exceptions that can be checked at compile time are required to be declared in the method signature using the 'throws' keyword. This forces the developer to handle these exceptions explicitly or to propagate them up the call stack. This explicit handling of exceptions helps to make the code more robust and less prone to runtime errors.

However, checked exceptions have their downsides. They can add boilerplate code and make the code more verbose. Additionally, they can lead to the "checked exception pyramid of doom," where a series of checked exceptions are thrown and caught, leading to a complex and difficult-to-read codebase.

Despite these downsides, the benefits of checked exceptions far outweigh the drawbacks. They help to ensure that the application can recover from exceptions in a controlled manner, making the code more robust and less prone to runtime errors. They also provide a clear contract between the method caller and callee, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

In summary, checked exceptions are an essential part of Java's error handling mechanism, providing benefits such as enforcing exception handling at compile time, ensuring a clear contract between the method caller and callee, and making the code more robust and less prone to runtime errors. While they may add some boilerplate code and lead to a more verbose codebase, the benefits far outweigh the downsides. I'd be happy to help you with translating the text you provided to English. Here's the English translation without any Chinese characters or punctuation:

There are a few things I consider important and revolutionary in terms of language features, which Kotlin hasn't implemented. I also found a very important Java feature that was blindly discarded by the Kotlin designers. This is the topic I'll be discussing today: checked exceptions. I'm not sure what the standard Chinese translation for this term is, so I'll refer to it as "CE" in the following text to avoid confusion.

Let me first explain what CE is. In Java, you are required to declare any exceptions that a function might throw in its type. For instance, if your function looks like this:

void
foo
(
string arg
)
{
// function implementation
}

Then, according to the Java language specification, if this function throws a checked exception (like IOException), you must declare it in the function's method signature:

void
foo
(
string arg
throws IOException
)
{
// function implementation
}

This way, the caller of the function is informed that they need to handle the exception or propagate it up the call stack. In contrast, unchecked exceptions (like RuntimeException) don't need to be declared, and can be thrown and handled at runtime.

In Kotlin, checked exceptions are not required to be declared, and the compiler will not enforce it. This is a deliberate design decision, and while it may simplify the language and make it more flexible, it also means that developers need to be more diligent about handling exceptions manually.

The Java designers introduced checked exceptions to ensure that exceptions are handled at compile time, which can lead to more robust code. However, some developers argue that checked exceptions can lead to excessive boilerplate code and hinder the flow of control in the application.

Regardless of your opinion on checked exceptions, it's important to understand their implications and how they differ from unchecked exceptions. In the next part of this talk, we'll explore some best practices for handling exceptions in Kotlin and Java, and discuss some common pitfalls to avoid. File name throwing FileNotFoundException

{

[Exception "FileNotFoundException"]

In English, the given Chinese text translates to:

A file name throws FileNotFoundException.

[Exception: FileNotFoundException] if (...){ throw; } // English translation:
// if (condition) { throw; } I. new class MyException extends FileNotFoundException {
II.
III. }

IV. public class Main {
V. public static void main(String[] args) {
VI. try {
VII. // some code that might throw FileNotFoundException
VIII. } catch (MyException e) {
IX. // handle exception here
X. }
XI. }
XII. } Java requires you to declare "throws FileNotFoundException" in the function header, otherwise it won't compile. This declaration indicates that the function may throw FileNotFoundException exception under certain conditions. Since the compiler sees this declaration, it strictly checks the usage of foo function. When calling foo, you must handle this exception using try-catch, or declare "throws FileNotFoundException" in the calling function header and pass this exception to the caller above.

try
{

In English, the text explains that in Java, when writing a function, you must declare "throws FileNotFoundException" in the function header if the function has the potential to throw a FileNotFoundException. This declaration informs the compiler that the function may throw this exception, and the compiler will then enforce that proper handling of the exception is implemented when calling the function. The options for handling the exception include using a try-catch block or passing the exception to the calling function by declaring "throws FileNotFoundException" in its header. following is the English translation of the given Chinese code:

foo {
"blah"
};

catch {
// empty block
} FileNotFoundException error

This is a common exception in programming, particularly in Java, indicating that a file cannot be found. The square brackets around "FileNotFoundException" likely denote that it is the type of exception being thrown or encountered. The "e" likely refers to an instance of the exception, which can be used to access more detailed information about the error. This kind of exception declaration and checking is called "checked exception". Many languages (including C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, etc.) have exception mechanisms, but they do not require you to declare possible exception types in a function's type or use a static type system for exception handling checks and verification. We say these languages have "exceptions", but not "checked exceptions".

Understanding the concept of CE, let's talk about the misconceptions of CE in Kotlin and C#.

Kotlin's documentation clearly states that it does not support checked exceptions (CE) similar to Java's, pointing out the drawbacks as "cumbersome", and citing several articles by well-known programmers, including Bruce Eckel and C# designer Anders Hejlsberg, to prove why Java's CE is a mistake, why it doesn't solve problems but brings inconvenience instead. I have read Hejlsberg's remarks a long time ago. His words seem reasonable, but through my own programming and design language experience, I found he didn't grasp the core issue. His arguments contain several logical errors, some contradictions, and some unwarranted assumptions, so his remarks didn't convince me. Conversely, real-world project experience tells me that CE is a crucial feature missing in C#. The absence of CE would bring significant inconvenience. When Microsoft developed C#, I deeply felt the trouble caused by the lack of CE. Now I will explain why CE is an important language feature and why Hejlsberg's criticism of it is unfounded.

Firstly, one of the most frustrating things when writing C# code for me is the lack of CE. Every time I call a function (regardless of whether it's a standard library function, a third-party library function, a friend's function, or even one I wrote myself), I wonder if it will throw an exception. Since C# doesn't require function types to indicate the exceptions they might throw, to ensure a function won't throw an exception, you have to check its source code, as well as the source code of the functions it callsâ€¦

In other words, you have to check the entire "call tree" of the code for this function to ensure it won't throw an exception. This call tree can be quite large. To put it simply, this means manually analyzing the entire codebase, traversing the entire call tree. This is not only time-consuming and confusing, but it's also easy to miss errors. It's unrealistic to ask people to do this, so in most cases, programmers can't be sure that a function call won't result in an exception.

Under these circumstances, you're forced to write your code as:

try {
// your code here
}
catch (Exception ex) {
// handle exception here
}

This not only adds unnecessary complexity to the code, but it also makes it harder to understand the normal flow of the code. Moreover, it can lead to inefficient exception handling and unnecessary exception propagation. CE solves this problem by allowing functions to declare the exceptions they can throw, enabling the compiler to check the call graph at compile time and provide better error messages and more efficient exception handling. By not having CE, C# developers are forced to rely on less effective and less efficient exception handling methods. Hejlsberg's criticism of CE is based on misunderstanding its benefits and the challenges it addresses. following is the English translation of the given Chinese code:

if (foo) {
}

try {
// code here
} catch {
// exception handling code here
} Exceptions
....

This is an English translation of the Chinese text "Exception". The text itself is just the English word "Exceptions" enclosed in curly brackets {}. I noticed this, and this is the worst exception handling code you can write when programming in Java! Since you don't know what exception may occur in the foo function, you don't know what to do in the catch statement. Most people can only put a log in there, recording the occurrence of the exception. This is a very bad practice, not only complex, but also possibly hiding runtime errors. Sometimes you find that certain statements mysteriously haven't executed, and after much trouble-shooting, you find that an exception was thrown at some point, and then ignored. If you forget to write catch (Exception), your code may run for a while before crashing, because an unexpected exception suddenly appeared....

So for languages like C# that don't have CE, you often have to write code in a mysterious way like this. The author was asked why there was a try-catch block there, and replied: "Because there was some exception there before, so I added a try-catch, but I forgot what exception it was, exactly which statement would throw an exception, the bottom line is that that part of the code would throw an exception...." Writing code like this makes you uneasy, and confuses those who read it, how can software quality be ensured?

But what about Java? Since Java has CE, when you see a function that doesn't declare exceptions, you can safely omit try-catch. So this problem in C# is naturally avoided, you don't need to wonder if you need to write try-catch in many places. The Java compiler's static type checking will tell you where you need to write try-catch, or add a throws declaration. If you use IntelliJ, the catch statement may be highlighted if that kind of exception is thrown from a certain statement. C# code cannot get this kind of help.

CE may seem a bit tedious, it seems only to make the compiler happy, but in fact it is something every programmer must understand. Error handling is not unique to Java, even if you use C language, you will encounter similar problems. You cannot escape this problem with any language, so you must understand it. In the article "Programming Wisdom" I already explained how to handle errors correctly. If you abuse CE, of course there will be unpleasant consequences, but if you use it properly, it will have the effect of reducing effort and improving code reliability.: Java's CE corresponds to a powerful logical concept, a fundamental language feature, known as "union type". This feature exists only in a few less popular languages like Typed Racket. Union type also exists in PySonar type inference and Yin language. Java's CE can be considered as a clumsy, imperfect implementation of union type. Despite its clumsiness and complicated writing, CE still retains the basic functionality of union type. Properly used, union type not only makes error handling unbeatable but also perfectly solves null pointer and other common issues. Through practical experience with Java's CE and union type in Typed Racket, I am convinced of its feasibility and benefits.

Now let me explain why Hejlsberg's criticism of CE is baseless. His first mistake, as the saying goes, is "man blames the tool, not himself". He blames the innocent CE feature for the unawareness, carelessness, and misuse of programmers. In essence, his argument translates to: "Since most programmers are dumb and haven't been properly trained, they accidentally and lazily misuse CE. Therefore, this feature is bad and useless!"

His argument is filled with such language:

- "Most programmers don't handle these throws declarations properly, so they add throws Exception to every function, rendering Java's CE completely ineffective."

- "Most programmers don't care about what type of exception it is, so they add a catch (Exception) at the top level of their program to catch all exceptions." some people's functions raise over 80 different kinds of exceptions, leaving users clueless about what to do.

Noticed that? This practice of adding throws Exception or catching (Exception) to every function, as mentioned in "Programming Wisdom," is problematic. To make CE effective, you must avoid this usage. You need to know what you're doing, understand the meaning of exceptions thrown by the called functions, and consider how to handle them correctly.

CE behaves similarly to union types. If you're not careful in analyzing, and haphazardly throw exceptions, you may encounter the "raising over 80 different exceptions" situation. This usually occurs when the programmer hasn't thought through handling their own exceptions and instead just adds lower-level exceptions to their function types. After multiple layers of calls, you'll find that the top-level function accumulates many kinds of exceptions, leaving the caller bewildered and forced to pass on these exceptions, leading to a vicious cycle. Eventually, someone gets frustrated and changes it to "throws Exception."

I encountered similar issues when using Typed Racket's union types. However, by strictly checking the exceptions thrown by called functions, minimizing their propagation, limiting the number of exceptions you throw, and reducing the potential exception range, you can avoid this situation. CE and union types force you to think carefully, and once you've sorted things out, you'll find that the code becomes incredibly precise and elegant.

Even if you're writing C code or JavaScript, these issues exist, but these languages don't force you to think through them, so they're often hidden and only become apparent much later, beyond repair.

So, these problems originate from the programmer, not CE itself. CE merely provides a mechanism; it's the programmer's responsibility to use it effectively. Even the best features can lead to poor results when misused. Hejlsberg used the "programmers are clueless" theory to argue against these issues. If we assume that all programmers write code haphazardly, we can derive astonishing conclusions: all language features used to prevent errors are useless! Since there will always be someone who doesn't understand these features' usage, they can always misuse, bypass, or write error-prone code, so static types are useless, CE is useless, ... languages with these features are garbage, everyone should just write PHP instead.: Hejlsberg discredits CE (Common Exception) in C# due to its misuse by lazy and careless people, leading to the belief that it is an unnecessary feature, resulting in everyone writing catch (Exception). In Java, a few people know how to handle exceptions properly, while in C# everyone is forced to regress to the level of the worst Java programmer. Hejlsberg also mentions that uncaught exceptions in C# code could be found through "static analysis," but he does not understand the scale of this problem. To find uncaught exceptions in C# code, you need to perform "global analysis," which means analyzing the code of a function, the code it calls, and the code those functions call, and so on. This requires analyzing an unimaginable amount of code and often without the source code. For large projects, this is unrealistic. In contrast, Java requires explicit throws declaration, effectively breaking down the global analysis problem into modular smaller problems. Each function author completes a part, and the caller completes another part. Everyone collaborates to help the compiler efficiently perform static checks, preventing missed exception handling, and avoiding unnecessary try-catch. In fact, tools like Exceptional in C# require you to write out possible exceptions in comments for it to find overlooked exceptions. So, Exceptional essentially reinvents Java's CE, but with the throws declaration written as a comment instead.

As for C#, there is another particularly annoying design flaw that caused a lot of unnecessary trouble. Interested readers can check out my article: "The Evil C# IDisposable Interface." This issue wasted two months of the team's time. So, as the designer of C#, I believe Hejlsberg's thinking is quite limited. We should analyze and argue critically with these people's statements, not blindly accept them as authorities, lest a valuable language feature be misunderstood and excluded from new languages.

Conclusion:

Hejlsberg discredits CE in C# due to misuse and lack of understanding, leading to a regression to poor exception handling. Java's explicit throws declaration allows for more efficient static checks, while C# tools like Exceptional attempt to find uncaught exceptions through comments. C# also has design flaws like IDisposable, wasting development time. Hejlsberg's thinking is limited, and we should critically evaluate his statements to prevent misunderstanding and exclusion of valuable language features. I have no conclusion regarding Kotlin. This article is just like all my views, for reference only. Kotlin has its advantages over Java, so it won't lose relevance just because it doesn't have a CE. I don't want to dampen anyone's interest in new things, I even encourage those who have time to give it a try.

Many people want me to give them a conclusion: should they use a language or not, so they don't have to worry about it. However, I don't want to give a conclusion. Firstly, I don't want to make people feel I'm controlling their choices, whether to look at something is their freedom, whether to adopt something is their own decision. Secondly, I don't have the time and opportunity to use Kotlin for real projects. Moreover, I'm tired of trying out new languages. If a widely-used language doesn't have any particularly unforgivable design flaws, I won't easily switch to a new language. I prefer to let others be my guinea pigs, to try out these new languages. Later, when I have time, I'll look at their success or failure experiences.

Therefore, for me personally, I won't use Kotlin for now, but I don't want others to be like me. Java, C++, and C already meet my requirements, they're quite stable, and I'm already familiar with them. Why should I spend energy to learn a new language, to deal with immature tools, and abandon the algorithms and data structures that truly interest me? In fact, no matter what language I use to write code, my mind is still using the same language to construct programs. The process of writing code is just finding the corresponding expression for the "universal language" in my head.
