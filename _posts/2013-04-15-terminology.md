title: "several cool professional terminologies"
---


Learned several cool professional terminologies from a colleague's blog, excited. These words can succinctly summarize several of my blog posts, my article quality is disappointing in comparison. Now let's get acquainted with some truly master-level English terminologies:

- Yoda Notation (Yoda Notation in C/C++ uses this expression order in if statements: if ("blue" == theSky) ... to prevent unintended writing like: if (theSky = "blue") ... The name "Yoda Notation" comes from the unique way Yoda speaks in Star Wars, such as: "Backwards it is, yes!" Colleagues believe this is a workaround for a design choice in C/C++: using = for assignment and == for comparison. This design fully embodies the essence of "Sins of our Forefathers." My views on Yoda Notation differ, please refer to "Where Yoda Notation Goes Wrong."

- Mental Speedbump (Mental Speed Bump) caused by design inconsistency that scatters user attention. For instance, many software like to pop up a window asking "Do you want to continue?"

- Pearl Effect (Pearl Effect) Pearls are formed how? By an object getting trapped between the mollusk's outer membrane and shell, unable to be expelled. The outer membrane is stimulated by the object, itching and painful, so the outer membrane secretes pearl substance to encase the object, layer upon layer. Over time, pearls are formed. In software, there are many such "pearls." Due to early design errors, users are forced to adopt workarounds or additional processes, similar to pearl substance. Over time, these workarounds congeal into "software pearls," unknown to their origins, they are cherished as treasures. Although formed from the same principle, "software pearls" are far from as beautiful as real pearls. (Compare: Sins of our Forefathers)1. The design left behind by our ancestors (Sins of our Forefathers) looked logical and reasonable at the time, but looking back, it turns out to be quite foolish. In contrast to "Pearl Harbor," these were deliberately added, not accidentally caused, although both result in "workarounds."

2. The term "Katrina Effect" describes a devastating scene that occurs after a hurricane, where everything has to be started over from scratch. This phenomenon is now common after reinstalling or upgrading software, or after installing software and requiring the machine to be restarted (closing all windows).

3. Workarounds are operations that users must perform due to development process failures. These are typically design errors.

4. Jenga Code refers to code that causes the entire system to collapse when a small piece is added. Jenga is a popular party game, as shown in the image. The principle behind it is to build a tower of uniformly shaped wooden blocks. Players take turns removing a block from the bottom and placing it on top. The player whose turn it is when the tower collapses loses. Afterward, this person must perform tasks assigned by other players, similar to Truth or Dare.

5. Higgs-Bugson is a hypothetical bug. It is usually inferred from a few records in the run log and vague user reports, but it is difficult to reproduce on a developer's machine. Heisenbug disappears or changes behavior characteristics when you try to observe it.
