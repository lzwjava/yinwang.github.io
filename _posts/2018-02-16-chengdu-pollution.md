title: "The fog in Chengdu"
---


Today is New Year's Day, I originally didn't want to write anything. But when I woke up early in the morning, I saw such a sky, the air quality was "heavy pollution" again. New Year's Day didn't even spare me, I couldn't go outside, so I didn't want to live through this year either, decided to write something before I was choked by the smog :).

For the past three months, the sky in Chengdu has always looked like this, every day as if the end of the world. When you can still see the sun, it's even more bizarre, seeing the sun in broad daylight is a hazy red-orange ball, the air is red and orange. This is only seen in the alien invasion scenes in Hollywood movies.

Don't be mistaken, this is not ordinary fog in Sichuan Basin, but severe smog. For the past three months, Chengdu has had severe smog almost every day. Checking the air quality historical data, Chengdu's winter has very few days with good air quality, which is much worse than Beijing and Shanghai. Beijing and Shanghai still have a few bad air quality days every month, but the majority of the time the air is still acceptable. But Chengdu? In the past three months, the number of good air days that can be counted on one's fingers.

Many people think that Chengdu only has air pollution in winter and are not aware of it. Winter lasts for three months, and every day with this kind of smog is already very uncomfortable. And Chengdu may not only have pollution in winter. Think about it, the winter fog in the north is severe because the north needs to burn coal to generate heat. Chengdu in winter doesn't have collective heating, doesn't need to burn coal, so where did this smog come from?1. In the summer, it's a little better, but the reason is that there are many rains in Chengdu summers, which wash away some particulate matter in the air. However, the summer rains in Chengdu are so frequent that people hate it, and everyone has to carry an umbrella every day. If it rains this much in other cities, the air would have improved long ago. However, Chengdu's summer air can only be considered bearable at best.

So this pollution should be a year-round phenomenon and not just a winter issue.

Please don't misunderstand, air pollution is absolutely not a natural phenomenon, nor is it caused by cars. This is a man-made disaster. Ask yourself a few questions and do a little research online, and you will understand how the smog came about.

1. New York and Tokyo, which are such large cities with so many cars running around or stuck in traffic, have excellent air quality every day. The PM2.5 is basically below 20. So it's clear that smog is not caused by car exhaust. I also noticed a phenomenon: the pollution in Chengdu worsens at night. Perhaps the air quality is light pollution during the day, but it becomes heavy pollution at night, and then improves again when the sun rises. If pollution is caused by car exhaust, why does it worsen at 3 am in the morning when there are hardly any cars on the road? This again proves that pollution is not caused by cars. Car exhaust consists mainly of gases, not solid "particulate matter." Apart from the original air composition, most exhaust gases are CO2 and water vapor. CO2 is not a pollutant. The pollutants in car exhaust are mainly SO2, CO, NO2, and the like, which do not increase PM2.5 values. If cars cause pollution, then these gases should exceed the standards, right? But they don't. This shows that pollution is not caused by cars. If you still don't believe it, just think about how a car engine works. A car's power comes from gasoline igniting in the cylinder and pushing the piston. If gasoline explosion produces particulate matter, then the cylinder and piston would be damaged. So high-quality gasoline should not have particulate matter impurities, it evaporates cleanly and burns cleanly without producing particulate matter emissions. Chinese gasoline should meet this standard. Old hand-pulled rickshaws and cars that emit black smoke are a thing of the past. How many times have you seen hand-pulled rickshaws or cars emitting black smoke in Chengdu? But why didn't they cause smog?
2. Check the air quality history. Why does the air quality in Chengdu become very poor at night, while it is slightly better during the day? Please think about it, what is different between Chengdu's night and day? Chengdu is not like Beijing, it doesn't have collective heating facilities that burn coal at night, so it doesn't need to burn more coal at night than during the day. So why does the pollution worsen at night?

[Note: PM2.5 refers to airborne particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, which is considered harmful to human health.] 1. You only need to search online for clues: It turns out those particles were emitted by the nearby factories. The factories hid the truth of their emissions by stealthily doing so at night, making it less noticeable to nearby residents. People closer by can see it, but it's not visible from a distance, hidden in the night.

2. Further investigation of the smog data map reveals that these locations are quite accurate. The most polluted areas are in the outskirts of Chengdu: Dujiangyan, Pidu, Chongzhou, and Pengzhou. If you observe the data by time, you'll notice that these areas start to get worse in the evening. Let's prove it further. To put it mildly, if cars can cause particulate pollution, wouldn't there be that many cars running in rural areas at night, causing such severe pollution? That's obviously impossible. So, what's causing the pollution? Isn't it obvious? Here's a picture my friend sent me when he arrived at Dujiangyan Airport in Chengdu at night. I experienced the same thing when I went out and came back to Dujiangyan Airport: the air was unbearably bad, and a plane took off and I could feel suffocated!

3. Furthermore, when I first arrived in Chengdu last June, the air was still good. The taxi driver told me that during that period, a central expert group came to investigate the smog, so the factories had shut down. But when winter came, the smog was much worse than in Beijing! Now you understand, right?
Hey, central expert group! Come and take a look here!:)

4. (Supplement on Chinese New Year's Day, 7th day) Starting from Chinese New Year's Day, the air in Chengdu and the surrounding areas suddenly improved. It remained in good condition the whole time. The air quality across the country also underwent a significant change, with most areas being green. Don't be too happy about it. This perfectly illustrates that smog is not a natural phenomenon and not caused by cars, but man-made. So, why did the air suddenly improve during Chinese New Year? Because the factories were on holiday! Wait and see when the holiday is over :): People in Chengdu are almost collectively unaware of smog. Most people don't know the harm it causes, and there are hardly any wearing masks during severely polluted periods. Once I wore a mask, a taxi driver told me: "Chengdu air is always like this. Why wear a mask? Get used to it...."

I suggest everyone study the harm of pm2.5 particles (particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers). These fine particles can penetrate through the alveoli in the lungs and enter other organs. Since they are small, they often cannot be expelled once they enter, remaining in the body for a lifetime. Additionally, the main components of pm2.5 particles are definitely not good. Have you ever thought about where your chronic sore throat came from? Why do you get respiratory diseases even if you don't smoke?

Let me tell you honestly, I have experimented with this. I originally had no throat problems. When the air pollution was particularly severe, I went out with a mask and had no problems. I could talk for hours with the mask on and still be fine. But as soon as I took off the mask and talked to people for a while, I soon felt uncomfortable in my throat, as if it was clogged and blocked, constantly clearing my throat.... Think about where your chronic sore throat came from ;)

Of course, the harm of smog is not limited to chronic sore throat and similar diseases. Although chronic sore throat is painful enough. Search the internet, and you will find that pm2.5 particles can cause heart disease, lung cancer, etc. The probability of death from these diseases increases with a 10Î¼g/m3 concentration change, and both short-term and long-term exposure to pm2.5 particles have an effect. This reminds me of the various strange tumors and cancers caused by inhaling dust after the 9-11 towers collapsed....: Why is pm2.5 so harmful? It's not only because it can penetrate the lung membrane and enter other organs, but also because of its chemical components. Have you ever thought about what's in the particulate matter coming from a factory chimney? I also heard that there might be a garbage incineration power plant nearby.... What are we inhaling, and it doesn't come back out....

People's misunderstanding of smog may be due to the fact that Chengdu's climate makes it seem like mist. Chengdu has always been famous for its fog, but fog is not smog. Fog is water vapor, harmless to the human body. I still clearly remember the feeling of inhaling fog as a child in Chengdu, it was so refreshing and soothing.... Now with smog, many people still think it's like the clean fog of the past, so they don't wear masks during severe pollution.

Moreover, many people also have a misunderstanding, they think that they are not polluted indoors. I also used to think that the particulate matter would settle indoors and there would be no harm. I was wrong.... Using a pm2.5 test meter, you can confirm that indoor pollution is actually similar to outdoor pollution, even if you close the doors and windows, there won't be much difference. The following picture is the test result when I was eating in a restaurant in a mall. The outdoor test result was similar.

It seems reasonable, pm2.5 particles are so small, they are very light, and not easy to settle down. So, don't think you have a place to hide outside! Except for sealing your own home doors and windows, turning on the air purifier, otherwise, the indoor air quality will not be much different from the outdoor.: The city of Chengdu is known as the "Land of abundance" and is a livable and relaxing city, yet it has been designated by the United Nations as a "livable city for humans." Chengdu aspires for greater development in human resources and technology sectors, constructing large-scale software parks and attracting various tech companies. However, Chengdu's pollution has become increasingly severe, surpassing that of Beijing and Shanghai. Persistent smog makes it almost impossible to go outside, and even when one does, it is far from comfortable. This has made life unbearably heavy and frustrating, almost like being in a prison.

Chengdu has always been a relatively economically backward region. Due to certain other reasons, the city's talent has generally left and talent drain has been severe. Most overseas talent is unwilling to come to Chengdu for development. Now, smog has made this situation even worse. I had initially planned to make a contribution in Chengdu, but for the sake of my physical and mental health, I was forced to abandon my plans for development in Chengdu. I will not buy a house in Chengdu, will not start a business there, will not work there, and will not recommend professionals in my field to work there. I am even reluctant to obtain the easily obtainable household registration in Chengdu. I will leave Chengdu in the short term and live in a place with good air quality.

Warning to Chengdu Municipal Government: The severe smog has harmed the health of city residents, tarnished Chengdu's image, and caused serious damage to Chengdu's development. If no action is taken promptly, it will bring significant obstacles to Chengdu's development. The government should investigate, pursue, and rectify factories that illegally discharge pollutants. Chengdu citizens: For the sake of your own health and that of your families, you should also be aware and take action.
