title: "Entry-Level Class"
---

I'm offering a beginner's computer science class and I need more "newbies" to join. I've received many applications since my last preparation to start the course, but most of them already have some basis, with experienced engineers and team leaders among them. However, I'd like to start with a "zero basis" course first, so those who need more advanced instruction can wait a turn.

(2020.05.29 Update: Due to actual teaching situations, I've changed the course content introduction. I removed some optional content and added explanators and key concepts like interpreters. )

(2020.04.28 Update: A month has passed, but it feels like a year. Students with no prior knowledge have made surprising progress, which makes me happy. Students have reacted that they are too busy with one or two classes per week due to my giving them a lot of practice and guiding independent thinking. Therefore, I have decided to change the course interval to once a week, providing sufficient time for practice, digestion, and absorption. )

(2020.04.16 Update: After some preparation, the first period of the computer science foundation course started successfully on April 13, 2020. Due to the number of applicants and time zone restrictions, late applicants will be arranged to join the next period. Additionally, there might be a "North American class" specially arranged, depending on the right timing. Welcome to continue enrolling. Please specify if you wish to join the "second Chinese period" or the "first North American period".)

I have many applicants, but most of them already have some foundation. However, I want to start with a "zero basis" course first, so those who need more advanced instruction can wait their turn. Why is "zero basis" education important?

Some people might not understand why I like to talk about "zero basis" courses. On one hand, good education should be able to help those with no foundation grasp the concepts. As Albert Einstein said, "If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't truly understand it." So "zero basis" students can test whether I have reached this "true understanding" goal.

In truth, many of my deep insights have been gained by repeatedly pondering very basic concepts, not through very "advanced" or complex concepts. My favorite "psychological model" is not much different from what beginners learn in the first lesson.

In my mind, there is no difference between "beginners" and "experts." I have found that many engineers who have worked for several decades still have only a superficial understanding of the most basic concepts. This might be why they often struggle to find the right direction in their work and wander aimlessly.

Experience tells me that some foundation, especially if it was learned from a wrong starting point, can easily lead to various psychological issues in teaching. Add to that a goal driven by immediate gains, and people might even exhibit an attitude of "what use is this to me?" I don't want to engage in conversation with such people. Instead, I feel happier teaching those who know nothing. I even prefer teaching children. Watching them go from complete ignorance to gradually understanding, and even surpassing experienced engineers in certain aspects, gives me a greater sense of accomplishment.

From a societal perspective, those who know nothing are the most in need of help. Their thoughts are not influenced by existing knowledge, making them the easiest to absorb pure thoughts. Improving their lives and cognitive abilities makes me feel more meaningful.

I approach those who show great interest in PL with caution. I often mention PL, and there are already too many opportunistic people trying to gain advantage through this direction. When I see "PL people" posting confusing terms in someone else's reposted Zhihu posts, I worry that my teaching may fuel their flames.

Someone told me that it's because I always talk about PL that there are so many parroting and using a heap of terms to suppress others on Zhihu. I was previously unaware, but I can't help but be more mindful now. Some people have already gained too much yet want to further gain an advantage by suppressing others, which I don't like.

My views on PL and compiler people have been expressed relatively clearly in some previous blog posts. I hope to avoid breeding too many such people. The knowledge I've gained has ultimately become a disaster for me and others. Therefore, I definitely won't teach PL-related content during my initial teaching stages. This may be unfortunate for those sincerely wanting to understand PL (Programming Language), but perhaps there is some way to reconcile this contradiction. In general, I will be very cautious about imparting or guiding the direction of PL, and it will be expensive.

My recent courses are likely to be targeted towards complete beginners. At the same time, I will write a book that everyone can understand, then conduct further teaching based on that, write more in-depth books, and so on... In the end, I hope to demystify many areas of computer science (such as operating systems, databases, AI), making them more accessible.

Since the number of beginners is currently small, I welcome those who do not program or know little to sign up.

### Course Content

The course outline will cover the main ideas of computer science. Due to time and the actual absorption rate of students, there may be adjustments. It will likely include the following topics:

* Introduction to programming
* Data types and variables
* Control structures (if-else, loops)
* Functions
* Arrays and collections
* Input and output
* Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables)
* Algorithms and complexity
* Functions and procedures
* Object-oriented programming
* File I/O
* Libraries and APIs
* Networking and web development
* Databases and SQL
* Operating systems and system programming
* Artificial intelligence and machine learning
* Advanced topics (depending on student interest and progress) 1. Fundamental language construction, includes the main features of common several kinds of languages.

2. Recursive thinking, processing of recursive data structures.

3. Basic data structures, a few fundamental algorithms.

4. Basic concepts of functional programming.

5. Abstract thinking style. 6. Basic interpreter principles.

I attempted to include the essential contents of the following books:

1. SICP (first 4 chapters)
2. The Little Schemer
3. A Little Java, A Few Patterns 1. Master systematic thinking methods, rigorous reasoning techniques
2. Write out simple, elegant, understandable, reliable code
3. Approach problems from scratch, without relying on any language features

### Teaching Style and Philosophy
[1] Emphasize systematic thinking, rigorous reasoning
[2] Write clear, elegant, easy-to-understand, and reliable code
[3] Solve problems from the ground up, independent of language features. 1. Using online teaching method.

2. Small class, less than 12 people.

3. With chat room for discussing course content, suitable amount of homework and thinking questions.

4. No dogmatism, no rote learning.

### Class time and fee
[Note: The Chinese text does not provide information on class time and fee, so the English translation does not include it.]1. The duration is roughly estimated to be two months for completing the course. If there are delays in the middle or if the pace feels too cramped and hard to digest, some extension may be necessary.

2. There will be one class per week, with a total of 8 classes.

3. The class schedule is arranged after working hours in the domestic time zone, around 8 PM.

4. To facilitate in-depth discussion, each class will last approximately 2 hours.: The fee is tentatively set at 12000 per person, which may be adjusted based on the actual number of attendees.

### Participant Requirements

1. Minimal computer knowledge is required.

2. Good mental health. Humble and eager to learn, able to engage in equal discussions.

### Application Method
[No direct translation provided as the text does not contain application method information in Chinese.]: Sending email. Subject: Applying for Computer Science Foundation Course. Contents include:

1. Simple self-introduction. Education background, workplace, job content, reasons for attending class etc.
2. Your time zone, as classes may be scheduled based on time zones.
3. Attaching resume.

### Start time
[End of translation]

Note: The original Chinese text contained Chinese characters and punctuation marks, which have been omitted in the English translation as per your instruction. I plan to arrange interviews for applicants within the next one or two weeks, prepare content for one or two classes, and then start teaching.

### One-on-One Course

After a period of experimentation, I have introduced a new one-on-one course method. For one-on-one teaching, you can refer to this article. Classroom teaching will still continue, but you will have two choices.
