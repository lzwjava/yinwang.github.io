I have written some negative evaluations of Go language in the past. After using it for several months to construct websites, I now feel it's time for a more "objective" evaluation.

### Position and Advantages

Go has its advantages over C, C++, and Java. Compared to C and C++, Go's strengths are its simplicity and garbage collection. Due to the historical issues in the design of C and C++, Go indeed looks more elegant and simple. Compared to Java code that heavily uses design patterns, Go code seems simpler. Additionally, Go's garbage collection reduces the mental burden on programmers compared to the manual memory management in C and C++. however, please note that the so-called "advantages" here are relative to languages like C. If compared to other languages, Go's advantages might be insignificant or even a regression. Some of these regressions are not recognized as such by many people, who instead view them as progress. I will now list some aspects that I can currently recall:

- Progress: Go has syntax support for a construct similar to struct literals, such as you can write code to construct an S struct like this: S{x:1,y:2}. This is a nice convenience compared to Java which can only create objects using constructors. These things may have been borrowed from the design of languages like JavaScript.

- Regression: Types are placed after the variables without a separator. If variables and their types are written in the Pascal style, such as x : int, that's okay. However, Go's writing style is x int, without the colon, and it allows the use of x, y int. This syntax, combined with var and function parameters, produces a disorienting effect. For example, you can write a function that looks like this: func foo(s string, x, y, z int, c bool) {...} Pay attention to the position of x, y, z. It's quite confusing because when I see x, I can't immediately tell what type comes after the comma (y). So in Go, I recommend writing functions with x and y completely separated, like in C and Java, but with the types written after: func foo(s string, x int, y int, z int, c bool) {...} This way it becomes clearer, even though it requires more typing. Every parameter is in the "name type" format, so I can immediately tell that x is an int. Although it requires more characters, it saves the "eyeball parse code" overhead. I. Type syntax: Go uses syntax like []string for types. Many people say this kind of syntax is very "consistent," but after a period of time I couldn't find the consistency they were talking about. In fact, this kind of syntax is hard to read because the parts of the type have no clear separator identifiers. If it is combined with other symbols, like *, you need to know some priority rules and spend a considerable amount of effort doing "eyeball parse." For example, in Go code you often see *[]Struct types. Note that *Struct should be combined first, then used as []'s "type parameter." This type lacks sufficient separators as reading "boundary signals," and once the type becomes complex, it becomes hard to read. For example, you can have *[]*Struct or *[]*pkg.Struct types. Therefore, this is actually not as clear and simple as C++'s vector<struct> or Java or Typed Racket's type writings.

II. Overloading: excessive "syntax overloading," such as switch, for etc. Go's switch keyword actually contains two different things. It can be a common switch (Scheme's case) in C, and it can also be a nested branch statement like Scheme's cond. These two statements actually have completely different semantics, but Go's designers, in an attempt to appear simple, merged them into one, resulting in more confusion. Even if you merge them, they still have different semantic structures. Merging the results means that every time you see switch, you need to separate these two different semantic structures from their "heads," increasing cognitive load. The correct approach is to separate them, just like Scheme. In fact, when I designed a language, I also made the same mistake, thinking that two things were "essentially" the same and merged them into one, but after a period of time, I found that they were indeed different. So don't underestimate Scheme; many things you think are "new ideas" have actually been discarded in the historical river of that very rigorous committee.

Go has other syntax design issues as well, such as forcing { to be at the end of a line and not allowed to be wrapped, and allowing assignment operations in if statement conditions. These attempts to make the program look short and compact actually lower the fluidity of program comprehension.

Therefore, in summary, Go's syntax cannot be easily called "simple" or "elegant," and its simplicity is actually below that of Java.

### Toolchain

The given text discusses issues with the design of Go's syntax, specifically the use of ambiguous type syntax and the overloading of keywords like switch. The author argues that these design choices make the language harder to read and understand, especially when types or keywords have multiple meanings or semantics. The text also mentions the lack of clear separators between parts of a type and the inability to wrap braces, which can make the code harder to parse and read. The author compares Go's syntax unfavorably to that of C++, Java, and Typed Racket, suggesting that these languages have clearer and simpler type and syntax designs. The text also shares the author's personal experience of making similar mistakes when designing a language and the importance of not underestimating the value of Scheme's rigorous design approach. I. Provided some convenient tools. For instance, gofmt, godef, etc. Go coding is more convenient than using Emacs or VIM for editing C and C++. Using Emacs to edit Go code can already achieve some functions that only IDEs have, such as precise definition jumping, etc.

II. These tools are useful, but the gap compared to IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio is still significant. The Go toolchain lacks basic functions compared to IDEs, such as listing all locations where a variable is referenced, renaming, refactoring functions, a good debugger (GDB is not considered good), etc.

III. Go's various tools seem immature. Sometimes you find that there are several different packages for solving the same problem, and it's unclear which one is better. Moreover, configuring these things is not very reliable and simple, and every small feature requires finding packages to configure from various places. Sometimes, after configuring a tool, it doesn't actually work, and you have to figure out the problem for half an hour. This disorganized, unplanned tool design is difficult to surpass the consistency of professional IDE vendors.

IV. Go provides a convenient package mechanism that allows you to directly import Go code from a GitHub repository. However, I found that this package mechanism often brings more trouble and dependency issues. Therefore, Go's advocates also designed tools like godep to bypass these problems, but godep itself also caused some strange issues, resulting in new code not being compiled and producing mysterious error messages (possibly due to godep bugs).

V. Many people become very enthusiastic about these tools after seeing them, but the reality is still far from making Go the dominant language. Moreover, with such a young language already having so many problems, I feel that all these troubles will accumulate and be a headache in the future.: Memory management

Unlike C and C++ with their fully manual memory management methods, Go has a garbage collector (GC) mechanism. This mechanism significantly reduces the burden on programmers' minds and the chances of programming errors, making Go a progression from C/C++ in this regard.

However, progress is relative. Go's garbage collector is a very primitive mark-and-sweep, which lags behind languages like Java, OCaml, and Chez Scheme in this aspect.

If you encounter GC performance issues, you can partially improve memory recovery efficiency through extensive tuning. However, the existence of such articles indicates that Go's garbage collector is still very immature. I believe that in most cases, GC should not be a concern for programmers, or else we lose the advantages of GC over manual management. Go code, therefore, still has a long way to go in real-time scenarios.

Due to the lack of advanced GC but the presence of high-level abstractions, Go cannot replace C and C++ in constructing low-level systems. The positioning of the Go language is becoming increasingly unclear to me.: In comparison to C++ and Java, Go lacks generics. Although some people dislike Java's generics, they themselves are not a bad thing. Generics are essentially parametric polymorphism as found in functional languages like Haskell, and they are a very useful feature. However, Java's implementation of generics has its flaws at times.

Because Go lacks generics, you have to write many functions repeatedly, each one differing only in type. Alternatively, you can use an empty interface {}, which is similar to C's void* pointer. However, using it results in code whose type cannot be statically checked, so it doesn't provide the benefits of generics.

Compared to Java, many of Go's data structures are "hard coded" into the language itself, and in some cases, special keywords and syntax were created to construct them (such as hash tables). When users need to define similar data structures themselves, they have to rewrite a large amount of code. Moreover, due to the lack of anything similar to Java collections, it's not easy to replace complex data structures. For programs that require extensive experimentation to choose the right data structures, such as those implementing specialized hash tables, Go's lack of these features is a significant barrier.

The lack of generics is an issue, but an even more serious problem is the blind rejection of this language feature by Go's designers and community. When you mention these issues, Go supporters will dismissively tell you, "I don't see the use of generics!" Such an attitude is more harmful than the language's own limitations. Go's designers have considered adding generics for a long time, but due to the language's syntax design being under-engineered, as well as the special cases (like Go's map syntax) that have arisen due to the lack of generics, the difficulty of adding them is significant. Go is similar to Unix systems in that it carries a heavy historical burden from its early days, despite not having learned from the lessons of the past.

### Multiple returns

Many people consider Go's multiple return values to be a progression, but there are many mysterious aspects to it. Apart from the fact that this is not really new (Scheme had multiple return values in let-values long ago), Go's multiple return values are used extensively in the wrong places—Go uses multiple returns to represent error information. For instance, the most common structure in Go code is:

ret, err

This design choice has led to a lot of confusion and complexity in Go code, making it harder to reason about and debug. It is worth considering alternative designs, such as error values or error channels, to make error handling more explicit and easier to use. error in function foo with arguments x and y.

Here is the English translation of the given Chinese code snippet:

function error in foo:
arguments x, y. if err !=

This appears to be the beginning of an if statement in a programming language, likely in Python or a similar language. The English translation is:

if error is not

or

if error is not equal to

Depending on the context, the value following "err" should be the expected value or condition. none

return

err if calling foo results in an error, then err is not nil. Go requires you to use a variable after it has been defined, otherwise it will give an error. This way, it "happens" to prevent the occurrence of an error err without checking. Otherwise, if you want to ignore the error, you must write it as

_,
err :=

-- function call here --

if err != nil {
-- handle error --
} fo, x, y, z

This appears to be a list or sequence of variables in Chinese characters, with "foo" being the first variable and "z" being the last. In English, it would simply be written as "foo, x, y, z".: When foo encounters an error, the program will automatically crash at that location.

To be honest, this "sideways compatible" approach, although it seems feasible, is not very rigorous from a type system perspective. Since it was not designed for this purpose, you can easily come up with ways to make it fail. Moreover, since the compiler only checks whether err is used, but not whether you have checked all possible error types, if foo may return two types of errors Error1 and Error2, you cannot ensure that the caller has completely excluded the possibility of these two error types before using the data. Therefore, this error checking mechanism is actually less rigorous than Java's exception.

Additionally, ret and err are both defined, while only one of them is not nil at a time, which is not enforced by the compiler but by the programmer's "convention." When err is not nil, ret can also be nil. This "or" relationship brings a lot of confusion, making it unclear every time you see a return whether it is returning an error or a valid value. If you realize that this "or" relationship actually means you should only use one return value to represent them, you will know that Go is misusing multiple return values to represent possible errors.

In fact, if a language had a "union type" type system like Typed Racket and PySonar support, this multiple return value would be meaningless. Because if you had union types, you could use a single return value to represent valid data or an error. For example, you could define a type called {String, FileNotFound} to represent a value that is either a String or a FileNotFound error. If a function may return an error, the compiler would force the programmer to check all possible errors before using the data, thus avoiding the above confusion. Those interested in union types can look into Typed Racket, which has the most powerful type system I have seen so far (surpassing Haskell).: So, Go's way of having multiple return values can be considered as "half-assed" and then continuing with a different approach instead of aiming for the bullseye.

Interfaces:

Go uses interface-based object-oriented design with interfaces to express abstract concepts.

However, this interface design is not without issues. Firstly, unlike Java, you don't need to explicitly declare (implements) an interface in Go, so you might "accidentally" implement an interface. This ambiguity is detrimental to understanding the program. Sometimes you change a function and find it doesn't compile, complaining that a certain location passes an incorrect interface, but the error message doesn't give a clear reason. You have to go through a lot of trial and error to find out why your struct no longer implements the previously defined interface.

Moreover, some people use interfaces just to pass functions as parameters. I don't always understand why, in simple cases like function passing in functional languages, Go needs to define an additional interface to implement. This makes the program less clear and more cumbersome to modify. There are many redundant names to define and redundant work to do. One relevant example is Go's Sort function. For every time you need to sort an array of some type T, such as []string, you must:

1. Define another type, usually named TSorter, such as StringSorter.
2. For this StringSorter type, define three methods, respectively named Len, Swap, Less.
3. Cast your type, such as []string, to StringSorter.
4. Call sort.Sort to sort this array. In functional programming languages, consider how simple sort is? For instance, in Scheme and OCaml, it can be written directly as:

(sort '(3 4))1. Here in Scheme, functions are directly passed as arguments to the sort function without being wrapped in any interface. You noticed that the three methods in Go's interface, in fact, should have been passed directly as three parameters to Sort, but due to the limitations of design patterns, the Go designers packaged them as an interface for transmission. Moreover, since Go does not have generics, you cannot write these three functions as in functional languages, accepting comparison elements as parameters, but instead must use their "indices". Due to these methods only accepting indices as parameters, Sort can only sort arrays. Additionally, due to Go's design being more "low-level", you need two extra parameters: len and swap.

2. In Scheme, functions are directly passed as arguments to the sort function without being wrapped in any interface. You found that the three methods in Go's interface were supposed to be passed directly as three parameters to Sort, but due to design pattern limitations, the Go designers wrapped them as an interface for transmission. Furthermore, since Go lacks generics, you cannot write these three functions like in functional languages, accepting comparison elements as parameters, but instead must use their "indices". Consequently, Sort requires two additional parameters: len and swap. In reality, the interface-based design of this kind in Go has a significant gap compared to functional languages. Compared to Java's interface design, it can be considered a regression.

Goroutine can be considered Go's most notable feature. Many people use Go because they've heard that goroutines support so-called "big concurrency."

First, this "big concurrency" is not something new. Every programmer who understands programming language theory knows that goroutines are essentially some user-level "continuations." System-level continuations are usually called "processes" or "threads." Continuations are familiar to functional language experts, such as my mentor Amr Sabry, who is a top expert on continuations.

Node.js's "callback hell," in reality, is a common technique in functional languages, called "continuation passing style (CPS)." Since Scheme has call/cc, it can theoretically implement concurrency without using CPS-style code. So, functional languages can easily implement concurrency as long as they support continuations. For example, a Scheme implementation like Gambit-C can be used to implement concurrent things. Chez Scheme might also be able to, but it's still to be confirmed. In implementation, the efficiency of goroutines may vary, but I'm just stating that goroutines are not as new, revolutionary, unique things as some people imagine. With sufficient motivation, other languages can also add this feature.

### defer function

Go has implemented the defer function to help prevent forgetting cleanup (recovery) when a function encounters an error. However, I've noticed a trend of misusing this defer function. For instance, some people perform actions that are not cleanup as defer, and eventually accumulate several defer statements, making it unclear which code runs before or after. Code placed in front even runs after the following code, which contradicts the natural order of code positioning.

Of course, this can be blamed on programmers not understanding the true purpose of defer, but once you have this feature, there will always be those who misuse it. Those who are eager to try out every feature of a language particularly enjoy doing so. This problem may take many years of experience before someone writes a book to educate everyone about it. Before the formation of uniform "code standards," I predict that defer will continue to be misused extensively.

So, we should consider whether the potential resource leaks that defer prevents are worth the advantages or disadvantages it brings. 1. Go library
The design of Go's standard library carries a strong Unix aroma. Compared to languages like Java, its library code has many inconvenient aspects. Sometimes it introduces functional programming styles, but due to the limitations of Unix thinking, it fails to fully exhibit the advantages of functional programming and instead introduces unnecessary complexity.

An example is how Go handles strings. In Java, each character in a string is a Unicode "code point" by default. However, in Go, the string type consists of bytes, so every time you need to correctly traverse each character, you must cast it to the "rune" type, and then cast it back. This way of treating everything as bytes is a typical Unix mindset, leading to overly low-level and complex code.

2. HTML template library
I have used Go's template library to generate some webpages. This is a "basic usable" template method, but compared to many mature technologies, it is quite deficient. What surprised me was that the code in Go's template was not even Go code itself, but a language with limited expressive power, somewhat similar to a degenerated Lisp, except it uses { {...} } instead of parentheses.: You can write a webpage template like this:

{ {define "Contents"}}
{ {if .Paragraph.Length}}
<p>{ {.Paragraph.Content}}</p>
{ {end}}
{ {end}}

However, since each template accepts one struct as filling data, you can use .Paragraph.Content-like code. But this is not only ugly, but also makes the template less flexible and hard to understand. You need to put all the required data in the same structure to access them from the template. any code exceeding one line, although it may be expressible in this language, is generally avoided in .go files by people to bypass this language's weaknesses. They generate data using these "helper functions" and pass it to templates to express the required information. Each helper function requires certain "registration" information to be found by the template library. Therefore, the complexity of these adds up, making Go's HTML template code quite bothersome and confusing.

There's word that someone is working on a new HTML template system that supports direct Go code embedding. This work is just starting, and it's uncertain what it will eventually become. So for websites, it's probably best to use more mature frameworks in other languages.

### Summary

Grace and simplicity are relative. Although Go language excels in many aspects beyond C and C++, and surpasses Java in some ways, it still can't compare to Python's elegance, while Python lags behind Scheme and Haskell in many aspects. In summary, Go's simplicity and elegance fall in the lower-to-medium range.

Due to the lack of clear advantages but presence of issues not found in other languages, I currently lean towards using Java-like languages in practical engineering. I don't believe Go language and its toolchain can help me write PySonar-level precise code quickly. Additionally, I've heard that Java can handle large concurrency without apparent drawbacks compared to Go. Alan Perlis stated that language design should not be about piling on features, but rather about diligently reducing weaknesses. From this perspective, Go introduced a few new features while also introducing quite a few weaknesses.

Go might have some unique strengths for optimization in certain specific situations, but I would not recommend using Go for implementing complex algorithms or an entire system.
