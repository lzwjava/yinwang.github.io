title: "Tesla's autopilot caused fatal accident"
---


It's been a while since I last paid attention to Tesla, but today I found out that their autopilot finally caused a fatal accident. This crash involving a Model S colliding with an 18-wheel truck occurred on May 7th, over two months ago. Tesla kept this incident hidden for two months until the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) began investigating it, forcing them to come clean. Due to Tesla's failure to promptly report the facts, the government is considering taking legal action against the company.

I had no intention of mentioning Tesla again, but due to Tesla's nonchalant attitude regarding this accident, not only hiding the facts but also continually finding excuses to absolve autopilot of blame, allowing this toy-level technology to continue endangering innocent drivers' safety, many people (including news outlets) have had difficulty analyzing the situation effectively. So I feel compelled to say a few more words.

The victim was named Joshua Brown, 40 years old, who had served in the US Navy for 11 years as a bomb expert before retiring and starting his own technology company. He had recently become passionate about Tesla's electric car technology and even established a YouTube channel to showcase his Tesla vehicle. Therefore, Joshua was quite familiar with the use of Tesla's autopilot. Sadly, this unfortunate event occurred with this expert user and enthusiast.

Tesla stated that on that day, Joshua was driving on a divided highway in Florida, following the regulations to enable autopilot. During the journey, an 18-wheel truck turned left in front of him. Due to the truck's white body and the white sky behind it, autopilot failed to detect the truck, did not apply the brakes, and ultimately, the Model S collided with the truck, resulting in the driver's death. The white truck contrasted against the white sky, making autopilot mistake it for air, an alarming situation...moving on from the issues with this technology, Tesla's reaction to this incident left many disappointed. Instead of conducting basic self-checks, they defended and shifted blame to the users. They first pointed out that the percentage of deaths caused by Tesla vehicles is much smaller than that of other cars. They then insinuated that even if the person was driving themselves, they couldn't have avoided the accident. Lastly, they repeatedly emphasized that the autopilot user manual clearly states that the function is not yet complete and that users are responsible if they fail to take control when necessary.

These are Tesla's old tactics. First, Tesla's lower percentage of deaths compared to other cars does not hide the serious issues with autopilot. The lower percentage of deaths may not be related to Tesla's technology, as Tesla is a new company, and its cars are new and less prone to mechanical failures. Moreover, Tesla customers are wealthy, well-educated individuals who understand technology, so they generally do not drive recklessly. However, comparing these statistics unfairly to other brands is not valid. Other brands have many more cars on the road, and these cars are often old and driven by various types of people, including drunk drivers, elderly people, and criminals. If you only consider recent years' new cars and luxury cars from other brands, their death rates are relatively low.

If you only look at the total mileage of autopilot navigation, the accident rate might be high, as many Tesla users may not have used autopilot or used it rarely. Autopilot has been involved in accidents before, as its visual technology is not yet mature, causing numerous near-misses, and it has been involved in several real accidents recently. A small percentage of accidents affecting one person is equivalent to 100% misfortune. Once you are harmed by autopilot, Tesla's statistics become irrelevant to you. Perhaps it has benefited humanity, but the harm is to you or your family, and it was due to autopilot's extremely poor judgment error.... Would you forgive Tesla because of the statistics and feel safe?

Additionally, Tesla likes to insinuate that autopilot's driving ability is superior to that of humans, but this is not the case. How can you prove that a human cannot avoid this accident? Tesla states, "The driver and autopilot did not see the semi-truck." How do they know the driver did not see the semi-truck? That's an 18-wheel semi-truck! A white car's side panel reflects on a white sky, so people cannot see it, isn't that ridiculous?

A thing being white does not mean it is invisible. An opaque object blocks the view behind it, and people are well aware of this. White objects also have reflections and textures that differ from the sky, and people can perceive their existence through these reflections. A semi-truck is not just white on its side; it also has black wheels, a smokestack, windows, and other colored attachments. To make other people see the size of a large semi-truck at night, it must have red warning lights on all eight corners, which are visible even in daylight. Even if the sky is white, people are not incapable of seeing the truck, treating it as if it were air. So, I suspect the real situation is that the driver noticed autopilot's mistake and tried to take control, but it was too late. The reaction time might not even be a second! People died, and there is no evidence to contradict this. I have observed a pattern from multiple incidents, despite Tesla's claim that Model S is equipped with radar and sonar for autopilot, its operation seems to rely solely on pixel data from cameras and neural network image analysis. Consequently, it failed to detect an 18-wheel truck of such enormous size, mistaking a tree shadow for an obstacle. Such errors are not something humans would make. I urge everyone not to be overly optimistic about autonomous driving technology and to be cautious. While machine vision is a useful technology, it still has a long way to go before it can be effectively used for autonomous driving.

Tesla did warn people that this technology is not yet mature, and that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and be prepared to take over at any time. However, Tesla should not have released an immature technology and heavily promoted it, giving people the impression that it is advanced and reliable, encouraging them to try it out. Moreover, the warning in the user manual may not hold up in court. If you require someone to take over at a moment's notice, you must provide clear warnings and sufficient response time.

The design of autopilot is problematic. It controls the car but fails to explain to the driver what it sees or what it intends to do, and when road conditions exceed its capabilities, it does not provide warnings, leaving the driver in the dark about its issues until it's too late to take control. You cannot tell if autopilot is making correct judgments when the car is traveling in a straight line. A car without autopilot (only regular cruise control) and a car with autopilot cannot be distinguished by the driver in terms of performance on a straight, even road. However, people expect a car with autopilot to brake, while a regular cruise control cannot, so they anticipate the car with autopilot will brake. It's only when you notice it doesn't brake when there's an obstacle in front that you realize it made an error, but by then it's too late.

Therefore, in such cases, Tesla, despite having a "disclaimer of liability," may still lose in court because their demands on users are unrealistic, and no one can take control in a timely manner when an autopilot judgment error occurs. I suggest the relatives of the deceased file a lawsuit against Tesla, demanding substantial compensation. I also advise all Tesla vehicle owners to disable the autopilot feature for the sake of their own and others' lives! Tesla clearly does not understand how to design an autonomous driving system, the technology is not yet ripe, and the design has flaws, making it more of a toy than a functional system. Life is precious, and it's not worth risking it as a guinea pig for so-called "new technology."

Love life, stay away from autopilot! I. The Great Wall of China
The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line to protect the northern borders of China.

II. History
The construction of the Great Wall began as early as the 7th century BC when several Chinese states built walls for their own defense. The wall was later joined and expanded by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century BC. During the Han Dynasty, the wall was further fortified and extended to its greatest length.

III. Length and Height
The total length of the Great Wall is estimated to be around 21,196 kilometers (13,171 miles). The average height of the wall is about 7.5 meters (24.6 feet), but it can reach up to 15 meters (49.2 feet) in some areas.

IV. Materials
The Great Wall was built using a variety of materials, including rammed earth, wood, brick, and stone. The most famous sections of the wall, however, are made of tamped earth and brick.

V. Defensive Structures
The Great Wall is not a continuous wall, but rather a series of defensive structures, including watchtowers, fortresses, and troop barracks. These structures were used to house soldiers and provide them with a vantage point to spot enemy forces.

VI. Cultural Significance
The Great Wall of China is a symbol of Chinese civilization and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also a popular tourist destination and a source of national pride for the Chinese people.

VII. Tourism
Tourism to the Great Wall has increased significantly in recent years, with millions of visitors each year. However, this has also led to concerns about the impact of tourism on the wall's preservation.

VIII. Restoration and Conservation
Efforts to restore and conserve the Great Wall have been ongoing for decades. These efforts include the use of modern technology to repair damaged sections and the implementation of sustainable tourism practices to reduce the impact of visitors on the wall.

IX. Visiting the Great Wall
Visiting the Great Wall can be a challenging experience due to its size and the crowds of tourists. It is recommended that visitors plan their trip carefully, including choosing the best time to visit and arranging transportation and accommodation in advance.

X. Conclusion
The Great Wall of China is a remarkable feat of engineering and a testament to the ingenuity and determination of the Chinese people. Its history, cultural significance, and natural beauty make it a must-see destination for travelers from around the world.
