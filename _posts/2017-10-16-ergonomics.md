title: "body science"
---


People who work long hours on computers start to pay attention to their health. Many people experience lower back pain, cervical spondylosis, and tendonitis among other annoying issues. Others, seeing their colleagues and friends contract these ailments, become more cautious. The usual solution for people is to seek help from "body science" (ergonomics). Many companies hire professional ergonomics experts to consult and adjust their employees' seating, posture, and work methods, providing them with various expensive ergonomic products such as ergonomic keyboards, mice, chairs, desks, etc.

As a long-term heavy user of computers in the computer industry, I have never had these issues (except for nearsightedness). I was surprised to find that non-computer professional peers of mine, who work nine to five using computers, have more of these issues than I do, even though I work longer hours in front of the computer. So today, I want to share my thoughts on these issues.

When I mentioned on Weibo that I was going to talk about ergonomics issues, many people started guessing what I would say. Some thought I would talk about a certain expensive chair, some asked for keyboard and mouse recommendations, some asked about standing desk work, and some asked about cervical spondylosis treatment and recovery...

I will indeed talk about some of these issues, but I am not a medical expert. I have never had cervical spondylosis, lower back pain, or tendonitis. So if you already have these issues, I probably can't tell you how to recover. I have no authority to be responsible for these issues, so regarding these issues, you should consult a doctor. I can only describe my experience here: a healthy person's way of maintaining health while using a computer. Additionally, I want to clarify some common misconceptions about ergonomics.

Of course, all of this is subjective and these are just my personal experiences. I hope they are helpful, but please do not blindly follow my words and hold me responsible for any health issues you may encounter :p

### Regarding "Ergonomics"

Let's talk about my perspective on "ergonomics" first. You might have noticed that any product can be labeled "ergonomic" (ergonomic) without any official certification. Food and drugs require FDA certification, organic food requires USDA certification, but what about "ergonomics"? There is no institution to certify it. I'm not saying that institutions like the FDA are trustworthy, but at least they provide some level of accountability.

What does this mean? It means that products labeled as "ergonomic" are not necessarily the result of rigorous research. They do not necessarily conform to the human body's structure, and some may even harm health. Ergonomics is not a scientific discipline that has been experimentally verified, and it is not even a serious academic field. It shares many similarities with weight loss drugs.1. Why do weight loss pills make so much money? Because it's a vague field, no one knows what's right. There's no government regulation, no scientific experiments, no clinical comparisons, making it hard to provide evidence and trace cause-and-effect relationships. Most weight loss pills are placebos, their effects are imagined by the users. People lose weight by controlling their diet while taking the pills, attributing the weight loss to the pills. This is called "mind over matter" :p

2. If a weight loss product doesn't work, many people would think it's because they didn't follow the product's instructions strictly enough. If a certain weight loss product claims that taking three courses can help lose 50 lbs, and it's ineffective with a refund, you finish three courses but find no weight loss, can you get your money back? No.

3. Weight loss pill companies can always find your loopholes. They can say that you didn't strictly follow their instructions, question if you took enough dosage and courses, or say your body type doesn't fit certain conditions, or you have other health issues, or you ate something you shouldn't have, or that you lied about your weight before taking the pills... In short, if you failed to lose weight, there must be other reasons besides the weight loss pill not working!

4. The same principle applies to the market of human engineering. If you sue a human engineering device for failing to help you and even causing harm to your health, or if you sue a human engineering expert for misguiding your posture, leading to a neck injury, the result is the same.

5. If you claim that using our human engineering keyboard caused muscle strain, what evidence do you have? Note, you must prove the "using our keyboard" and "suffering muscle strain" have a "causal relationship," not just that they "happened at the same time." Maybe you have other unhealthy living habits causing muscle strain? No one can prove what you do daily, or prove that you don't have other harmful lifestyle choices, so no one can prove the keyboard "caused" your muscle strain... Almost all the benefits of ergonomic products regarding human body are hearsay and cannot be scientifically verified. Someone tells you that this keyboard can prevent RSI, but he has never had RSI himself, how can he prove it can prevent RSI? Maybe he didn't get RSI even if he didn't use this keyboard. Maybe he didn't get RSI because of his healthy posture, taking rest, typing slowly, or barely using the computer.

You believed his words, bought the keyboard, but found yourself having RSI years later. Who can you blame then? The person who recommended the keyboard to you, the company that manufactured the keyboard, neither of them will admit their responsibility as you cannot provide clear evidence and cannot prove the causal relationship.

Therefore, for all "ergonomic products," you can only rely on your own feelings and judgments to determine if it really works. Often, these feelings are quite vague as you cannot know how a keyboard or mouse will feel after long-term use. It might not feel good at first but gets better with time, or it might feel very efficient at first but causes health issues in the long run.

That's why I want to share my experiences with "ergonomic products" here. I hope to raise people's awareness and caution about the term "ergonomics," not to blindly trust ergonomic equipment manufacturers or even ergonomics experts' recommendations. I found that many widely accepted habits and postures, popular "health" methods, have not been practically verified.

### Table, Chair, and Posture
[The text above discusses the unreliability of claims about ergonomic products and the importance of relying on personal experience and caution when considering such products. It specifically mentions a keyboard and RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) as an example. The following paragraph focuses on the importance of considering the table, chair, and posture in relation to ergonomics.]

表面上看，桌子、椅子和坐姿似乎与人体工学无关，但实际上它们对我们身体造成的影响可能比人们想象的要大。一个不合适的桌子高度或椅子高度会导致我们的腰部弯曲，导致腰部和肩膀不断发抖，最终导致脊梁骨和肱骨发生压力过大，导致肱梢骨痛、肱臂疲劳和甚至脊梁骨绕道痛。

一个不合适的椅子或桌子可能会导致我们的肩膀呈现弯曲的姿势，使我们的肩膀和肱臂处于不适当的角度，导致我们的肱臂处于长期弯曲状态，最终导致我们的手臂和手指感觉疲劳或痛苦。

因此，在购买任何人体工学产品之前，最好先考虑我们的桌子、椅子和坐姿。确保我们的桌子和椅子高度适合我们，使我们能够保持正常的肩膀和腰部姿态。这可能需要一些试错和调整，但长期来看，它会有很大的好处。

In appearance, a table, chair, and posture seem unrelated to ergonomics, but in reality, their impact on our bodies can be much greater than people imagine. An inappropriate table height or chair height can cause our lower back to curve, resulting in our waist and shoulders constantly trembling, eventually leading to excessive pressure on the vertebrae and wrist bones, causing wrist pain, arm fatigue, and even cervical spine pain.

An inappropriate chair or table can cause our shoulders to adopt a slouched posture, making our shoulders and arms remain in an awkward position for an extended period, ultimately leading to hand and finger fatigue or pain.

Therefore, before purchasing any ergonomic products, it is best to consider our table, chair, and posture first. Ensuring that our table and chair heights are appropriate for us, allowing us to maintain normal shoulder and lower back posture. This may require some trial and error and adjustments, but in the long run, it will have significant benefits. Elements of using a computer include environment, posture, and equipment. Environment includes rooms, tables, chairs, etc. Equipment includes keyboards, mice, etc. I'd like to first discuss the issue from the perspective of environment and posture, as the difference between the two determines the different ways of using equipment.

Common "healthy posture" diagrams usually look like this. This is the posture that "ergonomics experts" would recommend to you.

Many years ago, people used desks like this to achieve such a posture:

The key points of this posture are probably familiar to everyone, I won't go into detail here, in summary, it's called "correct posture with a slight backward tilt." Because this posture was recommended by ergonomics experts and written in books, many people followed it. Nowadays, many people no longer use computer desks, no longer adhere to these postures, but at least from this, you can see that "ergonomics" can be taken to absurd extremes.

Over ten years ago, I also used two or three desks like this. I've seen similar "healthy posture diagrams" many times, and I tried to adopt this posture. But today, ten years later, when I look at this picture, this desk looks like an old joke. Why did someone believe it was the most "healthy" posture? Why did someone put the keyboard in such a tray, with their elbows hanging, the keyboard's front raised, and their eyes directly facing the monitor in front of them...... These postures and practices are uncomfortable and unhealthy for me. I am convinced that the so-called "ergonomics experts" who drew up these posture diagrams don't know what they're talking about. These so-called "healthy postures" have not been scientifically tested. The computer table design that enthusiastically promotes these postures has not been put into practice.

These so-called "healthy postures" are just made up. It's the same as those so-called "health experts" who tell older people one thing today and another thing tomorrow. They say eat this, don't eat that, eat that, don't eat this. They say this is toxic, that is harmful, don't use a microwave, don't use an air conditioner, don't turn on the heater, be careful with cell phone radiation!... But the truth is, these people don't even understand science.

You know, over ten years ago, I used a desktop computer and this kind of computer table. Where was my keyboard located on it back then? Not in its designated tray, but directly on the tabletop. Why? Because I noticed a problem back then: placing the keyboard in the tray made typing uncomfortable, and my hands got tired quickly. So I put the keyboard directly on the tabletop instead. I moved the monitor as far back as possible, leaving enough space on the table for the keyboard and mouse.

Then I found that the elbow shouldn't be in the position shown in the "standard posture diagrams," with the elbow hanging off the body and not touching anything. This is tiring. Many people have probably noticed this problem, so the elbow must rest on something. Many people put the keyboard on a tray, so they have to rest their elbows on the chair arms. But chair arms aren't very stable, so they're still tired. Since I put the keyboard on the tabletop and moved the monitor and keyboard as far forward as possible, there's enough space on the table for both my forearms and elbows.

Many people experience soreness in their shoulders and lower back, which I believe is due to the results of these so-called "healthy postures." If your forearms aren't resting on the table, the muscles in your shoulders and back have to support the weight of your forearms, constantly in a stiff position. Over time, certain areas start to ache and get worn out.1. I don't use a specialized computer desk. Use a wide and sturdy office desk instead, without a keyboard tray. A cheap plywood desk is common, but it brings instability and causes fatigue. Don't use a glass-top desk as it is cold and slippery, a wooden desk is more comfortable. If there's no room for a desk, use a dining table instead.

2. Place the keyboard and mouse on the desktop (not in a tray). For a laptop, place it directly on the desktop.

3. The monitor should be in front of the keyboard and mouse (don't raise it). For a laptop, use its built-in monitor as much as possible, and try to avoid external monitors.

4. Don't look at the monitor with your eyes parallel, as it can cause strain if you keep looking up. The monitor should be slightly below eye level. Lean forward slightly, with a slight downward tilt, for a natural posture. However, don't place it too low, as this can cause neck strain. 1. Two arms, including elbows, are lying flat on the table. If you can't lie down, push the keyboard forward until you do. If still unable, extend elbows out. Imagine the posture for typing on the table like this :)

2. The table surface is best if it can swivel or electrically adjust. Raise it as much as possible to support upper body weight. If too high, lower it a bit. Generally, high is better.

3. If elbows rest on the table for long periods causing pain, slightly lower the table height or place a soft cushion there, or move the elbow bone to outside the table.

4. The chair height should be sufficient so that the thighs are not higher than the hips.

5. The chair back should be a bit higher, it's best to rest your head on it during breaks. The curve of the chair back is not important, as the back is not against it while using the computer. It's only used for resting or thinking. 10. A chair is best with armrests. This way, you can lean on them while resting or thinking, but avoid leaning on them while typing on the keyboard, leaning on the table instead is sufficient. I didn't recommend a $10,000 "ergonomic chair." I believe you can maintain good health with an ordinary chair.

### Sitting-standing office

Recently, many people have been popularizing standing-up office work. I tried standing-up office work, but honestly, I find it tiring to stand for a long time, it's not actually beneficial. So I mostly still sit, and when I get tired of sitting, I might raise the desk and stand for a while. But generally, I don't stand for too long, because standing is indeed more tiring than sitting!

I also tried sitting on a fitness ball and standing on a "balance board" while working. In the end, I put those things aside and no longer use them. Standing is not better than sitting, sitting is not better than lying down, this is a timeless truth! Change posture, rest, stretch bones

This is just a general posture that I use most of the time when I'm working on the computer. I'm not saying that working in this position for long hours without changing posture is good. It's important to maintain good health by occasionally changing postures and stretching out your back. Feel free to adjust according to what feels comfortable. When thinking, lean back a little and tilt your head back. If you've been sitting at your desk for a long time, you can pick up your laptop and go to the company's kitchen, coffee shop, or sit on the sofa.

Regarding posture, I recommend that everyone observe a cat's posture, as I was greatly inspired by Munchkin.

Spending time with a cat for a long time, you will find that this creature has many different ways of sleeping comfortably. It sometimes twists into postures you've never imagined. Then you try to learn its posture, and you'll find it's surprisingly comfortable. It turns out there are many comfortable postures in the world besides the traditional slumped position!

This is what I want to tell you: Change postures occasionally, try some strange stretching postures, stretch out your back!1. In addition, you can try doing some "yoga poses" during your rest periods. Many people associate yoga with going to a yoga class for an hour, but you don't need to spend that much time. I believe you only need to learn two basic yoga movements: downward dog and child pose, and you will reap many benefits from them. Maintain these two poses for a minute, and you will notice the effects.

2. In fact, these poses were inspired by animals. The downward dog yoga pose is actually a cat stretching its back (should be called downward cat). Moe-Moe Na often makes similar child pose movements.

3. If you want to learn more poses, you can go to a yoga class or adopt a cat and learn its poses.

### Healthy Typing Tips

Now I would like to discuss the issue of typing posture. Changing typing habits might improve muscle tension and prevent certain issues. The first sentence says "might," because I have never experienced those issues myself. My typing might be healthier, but there might be other reasons, possibly multiple factors. So, whether you follow my suggestions, please consider it carefully. Improving the Blind Touch Typing Method

Many people probably strictly follow the "standard blind touch typing method" depicted in the above image, but I find that it is not the most scientific or healthy way. Observing this method chart, it merely partitions the keys into several sections and assigns them to different fingers in a rigid manner.

At first, you might not notice the issue, but over time you will. The small finger is responsible for an excessive number of keys! The middle finger and ring finger have relatively long tips, managing only 4 keys each, while the small finger on the right side manages 16 keys, which is more than four times the number managed by the middle finger and ring finger. The small finger on the left also manages 11 keys. This is quite unfair.

The index finger, middle finger, and ring finger are relatively long and can easily reach their respective keys. However, the small finger, due to its relatively short length, can only reach certain keys with difficulty unless you move your hand or extend your small finger with considerable effort, causing your palm to distort and twist. I find that the keys that are difficult for the small finger to reach are: the 0, -, =, delete keys in the first row, and the ctrl and alt keys at the bottom.

Of course, you can force yourself to use your small finger to press those keys, but this might not be the most comfortable or healthy way. I observed this issue quite early on, as the small finger is relatively short, and I had to move my entire hand or extend my small finger with considerable effort to reach those keys, resulting in an unnatural hand position and potential health issues over time. Although it was not very apparent at the time, prolonged use could potentially lead to health issues.:

Solution is simple:

1. Use the ring finger to press the first row's 0, -, =, delete.

2. Do not use right side ctrl and alt keys, only use left side.

3. Use the left hand thumb to press left side ctrl, alt, and command.

Now let's try an experiment. Place your right hand on the "blind typing position," slightly extend your fingers. With the palm as the center, rotate your right hand to the right, sweep over the keyboard, notice which keys your little finger and ring finger touch. You will find that the little finger can only reach the keys of the second row, P, {, }. This means what? This means that the little finger is not suitable at all for pressing the first row's keys, it can't even reach those keys in its natural state. Extend your pinky slightly, do not move your wrist, you will find that your pinky can easily reach the first row of keys: 0, -, =, delete. In fact, I just typed out these characters using my pinky. You don't need to move your wrist or use much force, and you can easily touch 0, -, =, delete with your pinky. I can even touch the edge of the delete key.

Once I discovered this secret, I started practicing using my pinky to press these keys, and I quickly got used to it. This greatly reduced the burden on my ring finger, and my pinky was more than capable of handling this task without any complaints.

However, pressing ctrl and alt (option) with my index finger is not the most comfortable position. This requires bending my index finger into a hook shape to reach them. On a Mac, I should be using my index finger for the command key. This is very unfair to my left hand index finger.

So I came up with another arrangement: let the left hand's thumb press ctrl, alt (option), and command. Since these keys are next to the space bar, and the space bar is managed by the thumb, pressing these keys with the thumb seems natural. Additionally, I found that I never use the right command and option keys, so the burden on my ring finger was further reduced.

Furthermore, many Emacs addicts are still addicted to using ctrl-f, ctrl-b, etc. to move the cursor, which is not healthy. My solution to this problem is: use arrow keys, or command-left, option-left, etc. "direction combination keys." Of course, I don't use my index finger to press the arrow keys. I simply move my hand to the arrow keys and use my index finger, middle finger, and pinky to press them.: In summary, I'll explain it as follows using keyboard shortcuts:

1. Pressing a keyboard shortcut requires exiting the usual "touch typing mode".

2. If the shortcut is on the left side (like command-c, command-s), use the left hand's pinky finger to hold down command while pressing another key with the left hand's index finger. Complete the shortcut with the left hand alone, like "squeezing" the keyboard.

3. If the shortcut is on the right side (like command-i, command-p), use the left hand's pinky finger to hold down command and press another key with the right hand's corresponding "blind typing finger". Complete the shortcut using both hands.

4. Avoid using Emacs-style shortcuts like ctrl-f, ctrl-b for cursor movement. Use direction keys instead. Press them with your ring finger, middle finger, and pinky.: Sometimes you don't need to use fixed finger positions to press key combinations, just press keys as desired. For example, use the right hand's pinky and index finger to press the left side's command-s, use the right hand's index finger and middle finger to press the left side's command-r (refresh webpage)....

#### Avoiding three-key combinations

Someone might ask, what should be done if there are three-key combinations or more? Firstly, I try to avoid three-key combinations as much as possible. Three-key combinations are counter-intuitive designs that are hard to remember and not healthy. They should only be used in extreme, infrequent situations, such as restarting a computer (ctrl-alt-delete), or forcefully killing a GUI program. Unfortunately, many programmers use IDEs and editors that place some frequently used functions on three-key combinations.

For instance, the following is a list of some common key combinations in IntelliJ:

Functions like "Go to symbol" (go to symbol) that are used frequently are surprisingly bound to a four-key combination. Additionally, "Navigate back" is also frequently used but is bound to the unappealing "ctrl-alt-left" three-key combination. Emacs's composite keys are more inhumane. Not only do they have numerous three-key combinations, but also "key sequences" like 'C-x C-s', which means pressing ctrl-x and then ctrl-s. Do you remember how uncomfortable it is to press ctrl with your pinky? This means that some people have to awkwardly press ctrl twice every time they save a file.

More inhumane designs are Emacs composite keys like 'C-x b'. It requires you to press ctrl-x, then release ctrl, and then press b. If it were 'C-x C-b', it would be slightly better, as I don't have to remember to release ctrl before pressing b, I can keep ctrl pressed and use my other hand to press x and then b. However, pressing this key often makes me unconsciously keep pressing ctrl, resulting in 'C-x C-b', which is another function!

So if you find yourself frequently using such composite keys, I suggest changing it to a two-key combination. If this function is used very frequently, I will even assign it to an "Fn key" (Fn represents F1, F2, ...), allowing "one-finger zen" to trigger it.

Some people may feel that using the Fn key is unprofessional, like the behavior of non-computer professionals, and they want to "one-finger zen"... They believe that remembering these complex key combinations and even using direction keys less, relying only on keys like ctrl-f, ctrl-b to move the cursor, makes them a professional "hacker". I don't agree! The existence of gods like God, didn't they refute this argument? ;)

In fact, due to many hackers' infatuation or showing off mentality towards these composite keys in the world, they all turned out to be less than God. The infatuation with complex key combinations indicates that they lack rational thinking, so they will get carried away in other areas and write complex, difficult-to-understand code, design unfriendly products. I prefer to map the most frequently used functions of an IDE to a certain Fn key, and then map their variations to "command-Fn" or "option-Fn". For example, I set F9 to "set bookmark at this location", command-F9 to "jump to next bookmark", and option-F9 to "show bookmark list". What's the advantage of this? The advantage is that all functions related to "bookmarks" are on F9 or keys containing F9. I don't need to go to other places to find them.

If I encounter software that cannot be remapped, I can easily do it by using both hands and not following the keyboard layout!

#### Regarding "Typing Efficiency"

Perhaps you think that pressing combination keys causes the left hand to leave the home row, reducing typing speed. However, I don't think it significantly slows down the speed. The reason is that we usually think in a certain "gap" when pressing combination keys. For example, command-s for save, we usually wait until we finish a sentence or a function. Similarly, command-c, command-v for copy and paste, we usually select the text with the mouse and choose the insertion point.

During this "thinking gap", the typing "pipeline" is already interrupted, resulting in a decrease in speed. Therefore, your hand leaving the typing "home row" does not cause much inconvenience. I must remind everyone not to solely pursue typing speed. Unless your job is that of a professional typist, merely helping others input pre-written documents without thinking, you do not really require extremely high typing speed, not a moment's rest. Regardless of coding, writing articles or designing, the priority is given to thinking over typing. Thinking requires time, and my thinking speed is usually slower than my highest typing speed.

Therefore, to think, I always need to pause my typing and let my mind catch up. Many people not only type fast but also their hands outpace their brains, resulting in a lot of garbage code, garbage articles. The time lost for pressing combination keys compared to the usual pauses for thought is insignificant.

Now that I have discussed the computer environment in terms of posture, I would like to share my views on various computer input devices in the following sections. These devices include keyboards, mice, touchpads, trackballs, and other tools.

### Keyboard and Mouse

Some people ask me to recommend ergonomic keyboards and mice, so I would like to begin with these essential computer input tools. It is evident that poor keyboards or mice can increase the likelihood of various ailments such as carpal tunnel syndrome. However, is buying a $10,000 ergonomic keyboard and mouse the solution to this problem? I don't think so.1. I'd first tell you honestly, I use which keyboard and mouse. Most of the time, I use the built-in keyboard of my laptop. I don't use any external keyboards, including Apple's Bluetooth keyboard. When typing, my two arms form a "natural angle" with the keyboard, not vertical to it.

2. Most of the time, I use the touchpad below the laptop's built-in keyboard. I generally don't press it forcefully, I've turned on its "tap-to-click" feature. I don't use Apple's Bluetooth touchpad or mouse.

3. Occasionally, when I use a desktop computer, I prefer Dell's standard keyboard that comes with it. I don't use any ergonomic keyboards. When using the Dell keyboard, I keep it flat, without raising its back support. I use Dell's built-in mouse or a simple wireless three-button mouse.

In summary, my main tools are mostly a 2013 MacBook Pro. I don't have any other ergonomic computer products. Before using a MacBook, I used a ThinkPad T60 for over 6 years. At Microsoft, I used a ThinkPad X1 Yoga, which I wrote code on even in the dark without any issues. I only used its built-in keyboard and touchpad, without any external keyboards or mice, or the "red dot" of the ThinkPad. I guess you're surprised? I don't need any ergonomic keyboards or mice to work on a laptop all day long, writing code, articles, researching, browsing the web.... I often spend long hours at a time, yet I haven't developed any issues.

I have tried various other keyboards and mice. I bought a Microsoft Natural Keyboard and several other ergonomic keyboards in the past. I even bought an expensive mechanical keyboard. I tried various ergonomic mice, trackballs, and Apple's large blue tooth touchpad. I even considered buying expensive, uniquely shaped keyboards like Kinesis, Data Hand, ...

In the end, I gave up on all these ergonomic input devices that claim to save health, and only left with a MacBook. Why? I'm here to tell you about the issues I found with these ergonomic input devices.

#### Desktop Keyboards

I always try to use a laptop instead of a desktop, and when I'm forced to use a desktop, I don't use those oddly shaped "ergonomic keyboards." So, what keyboard do I use? I just use the keyboard that comes with the Dell desktop :) I don't buy that cheap keyboard because I'm stingy, but because I really find it comfortable. I've tried quite a few other keyboards, but I find that this unassuming cheap keyboard is the most comfortable. Why is that?

Analyzing the reasons, I think there are a few key points:

1. This keyboard barely has a border, so it doesn't take up extra space, allowing my hands to rest directly on the outside of the table.

2. It's very lightweight, so I can easily move it to any comfortable position on the table.

3. The key travel and force are both comfortable.: It's simple, with no excess keys or functions.

Regarding the first point, I'd like to explain further. Some people prefer keyboards with built-in wrist rests, believing that lifting their hands higher aligns with "ergonomics." If they use a keyboard without a wrist rest, they often buy one to place underneath, like so:

I've bought wrist rests before, but after many trials, I found it uncomfortable. The most comfortable setup, in my opinion, is to place your hands directly on the table outside the keyboard. Since Dell keyboards have almost no edges, the space bar is directly on the table, allowing you to easily place your hands outside.

Why don't I like wrist rests? Because I believe an important aspect of ergonomics is the ability to adjust the keyboard position according to your seating position. Having the keyboard adapt to your position, rather than the other way around. With a wrist rest, the keyboard position is fixed, making it less convenient to move. Moreover, the underside of most wrist rests has an adhesive layer, making it impossible to slide on the table.

Additionally, these wrist rests are nowhere near as stable as a tabletop. If your hands aren't stable on them, you'll experience a slight tension, which can lead to fatigue over time. Many people still prefer to stand up the shelves in front of keyboards, like this:

I think this is a wrong method. Because raising the keyboard in front, it will force the typing fingers to lift up, making the forearm and tendon muscles more tense. The most relaxed way should be to keep the keyboard flat or let the front part slightly lower (not higher). Since I couldn't find a good way to make the keyboard's shelf go down without sacrificing other requirements, I usually fold it up and keep the keyboard flat.

#### Microsoft Natural Keyboard

The most common ergonomic keyboard is likely the Microsoft Natural Keyboard. This keyboard separates the keys controlled by both hands into two halves, leaving a gap in the middle. In this way, each hand is placed on one side, forming an angle. Note, I don't recommend this keyboard. I only introduce a healthy typing posture through one of its features.

Many people believe that keeping both hands at a certain angle is more healthy, which is true. It's obvious that if your two hands are placed end-to-end and vertical to the direction of the keys, due to the width of the shoulders being greater than the distance between the hands, the wrists will present an unnatural twisted state, which will definitely cause problems in the long run.ally, you don't really need Microsoft's natural keyboard to prevent awkward posture. Although the keys on a laptop keyboard are evenly arranged, both my hands still adopt a "natural angle" when typing. You might argue that the keyboard is flat, so how can you type accurately with your hands at such an angle? In fact, you can indeed type with your hands in a natural position, yet still type accurately on any standard keyboard. You don't need to turn the keyboard's keys at an angle. This is because human fingers are quite flexible and can easily move to any reachable position. All you need to do is adapt slightly, and you can type accurately.

Why don't I use Microsoft's natural keyboard then? Isn't its angle good? The reason I don't use it is because it's not comfortable to use, causing tension and fatigue. This keyboard separates the keys in the middle, leaving a blank space next to the keys controlled by the pinky finger. So, the keys next to it lack a physical and psychological "border."

To be more specific, if it's a standard keyboard, you use your right hand pinky to press the Y key. If your pinky finger extends too far, it will touch the edge of the T key. This tactile feedback information helps your pinky finger return to the Y key, and the whole process doesn't require you to look at the keys. However, a natural keyboard is different. If your pinky finger presses the Y key too far, it goes into the gap instead. You can't effectively use the edge of the T key to "feel your way back" to the Y key's original position.

Therefore, your pinky finger is prone to pressing into that gap. To prevent accidentally pressing into that space, your mind needs to give your pinky finger more control. Although this force isn't significant, it causes a slight tension in the brain and muscles, which accumulates over time and leads to fatigue.

Additionally, some keys on this keyboard have odd sizes and shapes due to this "split design." For example, the space bar is wider than usual and must be curved, making it feel unbalanced and less smooth to press. The entire keyboard has a certain slope, supposedly for "natural" typing, but I find it causes muscle tension in my forearm to adapt to this slope. I find the entire keyboard arched quite high, and I discovered that if the keyboard is too far from the desk, my hands would be in an uncomfortable position, even with a wrist rest. This is because my elbow is on the desk, and although the wrist rest lifts the wrist, it cannot change the awkward angle from the hand to the elbow.

(Why my elbow is on the desk, instead of being on the desk rest or suspended, I have explained in a previous session.)

Furthermore, this keyboard is large, wide, and heavy, so it is not like a regular keyboard that can be easily moved to your preferred position. Once placed on the table, the keyboard becomes almost fixed in place. You have to adapt to its position rather than easily adjusting it to suit your own posture. Such a non-movable device may cause discomfort and injury due to forcing you to use an unsuitable posture.

Therefore, although Microsoft's Natural Keyboard keeps my hands in a natural position, I don't use this type of keyboard. With a standard laptop keyboard, my hands can still maintain a "natural angle," preventing the formation of a wrist deformity and excessive fatigue.

#### Mechanical Keyboard

However, I recently tried using a mechanical keyboard, and I found that it allowed me to maintain a more comfortable position, as the keys have a tactile feedback that requires less force to press. This reduced the strain on my hands and wrists, allowing me to type for longer periods without discomfort.

In conclusion, while I initially believed that using a specialized ergonomic keyboard was necessary to maintain a healthy typing posture, I have found that a standard laptop keyboard with a proper wrist rest and a mechanical keyboard can also provide a comfortable typing experience. The key is to listen to your body and make adjustments as needed to ensure that your hands and wrists are in a comfortable and natural position while typing. many programming or gaming enthusiasts are fond of mechanical keyboards. This type of keyboard uses old-fashioned mechanical switches, with various "colors" of mechanisms, producing various distinct clicking sounds. Many people find the sound of the keyboard cool, professional, and classic, so they spend a lot of money to buy mechanical keyboards.

I also tried a mechanical keyboard once, and I bought a decent one that cost over two hundred dollars. I even bought the type with a shorter key travel and lighter force. However, after trying it for a few minutes, I found that compared to the MacBook keyboard, this mechanical keyboard required more effort.

Don't underestimate the slight difference in key travel and force, which affects millions of keystrokes. Over time, this difference leads to fatigue. After an hour, I clearly felt the muscles in my forearms starting to tire and tense up.

In the long run, this fatigue could lead to tendonitis or RSI. Therefore, I stopped using the keyboard on the first day and returned it.

After trying various keyboards, I eventually found that the MacBook keyboard (old version) had just the right key travel and force. Typing on it felt effortless, and the sound was quiet. In fact, typing is best without a "click" sound, which is better for both yourself and those around you. Kinesis Keyboard and DataHand

Kinesis and DataHand are two ergonomic keyboards with comparable high prices. I have never bought them, but I have seen people use these two keyboards.

Kinesis places the keys in two concave "wells." The legend is that this position allows the fingers to stretch out as much as possible, preventing certain issues from occurring.

DataHand is a "keyboard" with hardly any hand movement required. Each finger is placed in a depression, with a few triggerable mechanisms next to it. Consequently, fingers hardly need to move to input.

I did consider purchasing them, given the health benefits, but ultimately I gave up on the idea. Why? Because:

1. Cost: Both keyboards are expensive.
2. Learning curve: Adjusting to the new layout and feel of the keys took time and practice.
3. Size: The unique designs made them larger than standard keyboards, taking up more desk space.
4. Feedback: The keys did not provide the tactile feedback I was used to, making typing feel less satisfying.
5. Customization: The customization options were limited, and I preferred having more control over the layout and settings of my keyboard.

In the end, I decided that the benefits did not outweigh the costs and challenges for me. However, for those who prioritize ergonomics and are willing to invest in these specialized keyboards, they may find significant improvements in comfort and health. 1. I have never had any problems using a notebook computer's keyboard. I've used it for over a decade without any issues, which suggests that perhaps the keyboard isn't harmful.

2. These two peculiar keyboards are significantly different from regular keyboards, so there is a need for a considerable adaptation process. Since the notebook keyboard hasn't caused me any serious issues over the past ten years, I'm unsure if it's worth investing time and effort to adapt to these unusual things. I still can't five-finger input, and the reason is the same: pinyin input method is already quite good enough :p

3. Once I'm accustomed to these keyboards, I'd probably be unable to use anyone else's computer. I'd have to carry these keyboards with me wherever I go, adding a lot of complexity to my life.

4. I'm not very confident that the "ergonomics" of these keyboards have undergone scientific testing. Whether a keyboard causes hand injuries or not depends on long-term use. Perhaps these strangely designed keyboards not only don't prevent injuries but may even cause them? I don't have enough evidence to prove they meet "ergonomic" standards. If anyone is injured by them, I wouldn't know. These suffering people have no voice, and you won't hear their tragic stories.

5. Those recommending these keyboards to me mostly exhibit a "fanatic" mentality. These people's work methods and attitudes are very different from mine, and in academic research, they also display a dogmatic attitude. So, I'm not very convinced that these keyboards bring any real benefits. I continue to use the keyboard that comes with the MacBook. No issues whatsoever, why look for trouble when there is none?

Next, let's talk about the mouse. I haven't used a mouse for many years now, as I find the touchpad on notebook computers more comfortable, and its accuracy and efficiency are higher than that of a mouse. However, I did try out quite a few "ergonomic mice" in the past, only to give them all up in the end. Now, I'll explain why I don't use a mouse, especially not those called "ergonomic mice."

So-called ergonomic mice are always designed with various strange curved shapes, like the ones shown in the picture above. You might think that since they look like that, the designers must certainly understand "ergonomics," so they should be comfortable to use and won't cause any problems. But once you bring one home, you often find that it's not as good as a regular mouse.

One common problem with ergonomic mice is that they are made in a streamlined shape, wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. The curve makes it feel like a good fit in your hand, but what's the issue? The problem lies in the fact that, because it's wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, and the gripping area is very smooth, it's difficult to lift the mouse from the desk. All mouse users know that you can't keep pushing the mouse on the table forever. Often, you need to pick up the mouse, move away from the desk, and create enough "running track" for the mouse pointer to move a longer distance. However, the current mouse designs make it difficult to pick them up, so the hassle is yours. You need to use much more force than usual to lift them off the table. This is very tiring and not ergonomic.

Another problem with ergonomic mouse designs is that they seem to love placing several "special function buttons" on the mouse, but these buttons are easily bumped into when holding the mouse. Consequently, you often unintentionally activate these buttons, causing unexpected events. Even if you disable these unnecessary functions in the operating system, the buttons still emit an annoying click sound when pressed, causing anxiety about potential consequences.

Therefore, the best mouse should have a maximum of three buttons: left, right, and a middle scroll wheel.

Recently, vertical mice have become popular, meaning your hand is sideways when holding it instead of your palm facing down. The rumor is that this position is the "natural position" for the hand, making it protective. However, when you try it out, you'll discover a significant problem. Since you need to hold it sideways, this mouse must be placed between your thumb and the other four fingers. Therefore, when you want to move your hand to the keyboard to type, you find it blocked by the mouse, requiring you to climb over a mountain to get through. Additionally, this mouse is also difficult to lift from the table, and the problem is even more severe. When you try to lift it and move it, you accidentally press the mouse keys. So I'm really puzzled as to why people spend a lot of money on it.

Moreover, I don't use Apple's mouse. Although it looks good and has "design appeal," it's uncomfortable to use. The most serious issue is that it's too flat, so the top surface can't support the palm. Furthermore, only one edge is available for you to grip, and it doesn't even have a "face." Therefore, holding it is tiring and uncomfortable. Due to its "buttonless" design, pressing it feels unstable, and it's hard to tell if you've pressed it or not, and the feedback is poor. I chose the simplest and cheapest mouse among the various so-called "ergonomic mice" I tried years ago. It has a slightly narrower bottom than the top or a dip in the middle, and has a rubber side, making it easy for me to pick up from the desk. It has only two buttons and a wheel, with no extra buttons on the side, so I won't accidentally press the pretty buttons.

Moreover, the force required for the mouse keys should be light. Don't underestimate this force, as a mouse button that is too hard will cause pain in my finger after prolonged use, making it impossible to use the mouse or pick up things! My finger has experienced this pain and it took a long time to recover. Therefore, I no longer use a mouse with heavy keys.

For example, a mouse like this would still work:

Later, I found that the touchpad on my notebook computer is actually the most comfortable and efficient mouse, so I stopped using the mouse after that.

#### Apple Bluetooth Touchpad though I feel that the touchpad on a MacBook is the most comfortable, I don't use Apple's external Bluetooth touchpad. In fact, I bought one and returned it within two days. Why? Because it's not as good as the one on the MacBook.

The issue is similar to a mouse, but this touchpad must be placed on the keyboard side, unlike the MacBook touchpad which is fixed below the keyboard. So you have to move your hand from the keyboard to use this external touchpad, making your hand have to move left and right. The distance between the keyboard and touchpad on this external touchpad is much greater than on the MacBook, and it's not comfortable.

The most serious problem is that this touchpad is too large, so when your hand is above it, there's nowhere to rest. The MacBook touchpad isn't as large, and the case around it is almost the same height, so there are quite a few places to rest your hand next to the touchpad. However, this external touchpad is so large that when it's on your body's right side and its plane is higher than the table, your hand can't find a comfortable support point next to it.

Unlike a mouse, if your hand needs to rest on the touchpad, you have to lift your fingers high enough so they don't touch the touchpad, causing the pointer to move or click. Additionally, the touchpad's surface is raised, so the angle at which you lift your fingers is even greater. Lifting your fingers requires the muscle in your upper arm, which is the same muscle that often gets RSI. This way of raising the touchpad is similar to how some people like to lift the front of their keyboard, which I believe is also incorrect.

So I found that I had tension in my upper arm muscles after using this touchpad for a short time. I then realized the cause was that my muscles and tendons had to lift my fingers to keep my hand above the touchpad. I remembered a classmate who got RSI and had to wear a splint on that muscle every day, so I immediately stopped using the external touchpad and returned to the MacBook touchpad and keyboard. I. People who buy this kind of touchpad usually do so because they use external monitors and keyboards at work, so they also need to use external mice and touchpads. Since I don't use a mouse, but the touchpad has this issue, I also stopped using the external keyboard. Using the MacBook's own keyboard and touchpad, the size and position are just right.

II. A classmate strongly recommended a trackball to me in school, so I bought one to try. The classmate who recommended the trackball also showed off his DataHand keyboard. The advantage of a trackball over a mouse is that it doesn't need to be moved on the desk, and you don't have to pick it up. However, I returned it a few days after getting it. What was wrong with it?

III. You may have noticed that a trackball is essentially a reversed old-style mouse? A long time ago, mice didn't have optical sensors but a ball that could be rolled. When you moved the mouse, the ball began to roll, causing several axles to turn, and the software determined the cursor position based on the rotation of the axles.

IV. The ball mouse has a problem: after using it for a while, the ball gets dirty, and the dirt accumulates on the axle. Over time, it becomes less responsive. If the mouse is not made precisely, the ball or axle may deform, and no matter how you clean it, it will not be smooth again. A mouse ball only needs to touch the desk, it's relatively clean environment. But a flipped mouse, the problem is more serious. Your hands might have just eaten potato chips.... So dirty stuff is more likely to stick to the ball. Making this size ball smooth and able to roll easily is already a challenge. Add hand dirt, and it becomes even more difficult.

Perhaps you might think, just spend more money and buy a better tracking ball. Frankly speaking, the tracking ball I bought is expensive enough. But you'll find out, this isn't about money or workmanship. To make a smooth tracking ball is much harder than making a smooth mouse. Expensive doesn't necessarily mean it will be good or last long. To make a good tracking ball, this is an unnecessary difficulty.

A tracking ball also has a problem, that the ball generally protrudes a certain height, so your hand resting on it is a forward-lifting, unhealthy angle. Tracking balls are usually large, so the button on the side is hard to find a place to rest your hand. So a tracking ball has a problem similar to that of an Apple Bluetooth touchpad: finding a place to rest your hand.

The mouse evolved from a ball mouse to an optical mouse, but the tracking ball remained in the ball mouse era. If the tracking ball evolved into the "optical age," what would it look like? You'll find out with a little thought, it would evolve into a touchpad! The operation method of a touchpad, isn't it the same as that of a tracking ball? Only the rolling ball is replaced by a surface that can sense capacitance.

So a touchpad combines the advantages of an optical mouse and a tracking ball, which is why a touchpad became my final choice.: The ThinkPad's red dot (the red joystick in the middle of the keyboard, which can be used as a mouse) is considered a good thing by many people. Indeed, it has certain advantages over a touchpad. Since it's in the middle of the keyboard, your hand doesn't have to leave the keyboard to move the cursor.

I used to like using the red dot myself, I thought it was very efficient. Because I got addicted to the red dot, I didn't use the touchpad below it for a long time. Until one day, my index finger started to hurt.... I couldn't use the red dot anymore, and I couldn't even use my index finger to pick things up. So I understood that prolonged and frequent use of the red dot could cause finger injury. Fortunately, after a few months, my finger recovered. Since then, I have stopped using the red dot and turned to the touchpad.

After using a touchpad for more than ten years, I found that the damage caused by the red dot could not be replicated on the touchpad. Because when using the touchpad, my fingers barely apply any pressure. I set the touchpad to "light tap mode," which means lightly tapping it once for a mouse click. So I rarely press the MacBook touchpad or the ThinkPad touchpad button. Therefore, the force of contact between my hand and the touchpad is very small, it cannot cause the type of injury caused by the red dot.

I'm not saying that it's completely impossible to use the red dot, but you should know that it puts some pressure on the nerve cells at the tip of your fingers. So when using the red dot, don't press too hard and don't be in a hurry. Constantly pressing too hard is because you want the cursor to move quickly, so you have to push the red dot hard, and over time it will hurt. I have summarized some experiences I have gained in the field of ergonomics after using computers for over a decade. These may differ significantly from the common methods of ergonomics that are promoted. I hope they prove helpful.
