I'd like to publish this paper on the "P vs NP" problem for the "greatest computer scientist"

A few years ago, I wrote an article expressing my views on the famous computer science problem of "P vs NP." At the time, it was during my Nth research phase, and since I had seen through it and didn't care, I wrote it very casually. To my surprise, someone took it and used it to belittle me, taking full advantage of their abilities to shame. They said, "Wang Jian is too self-righteous. You write those blogs all day, what value do you have? You even dare to criticize 'P vs NP.' Do you know that if 'P vs NP' is solved, the world will undergo a cataclysmic change, countless computational problems will be solved, machine learning will no longer be necessary, and symmetric encryption will be broken...." They went on and on like a lecture, almost memorizing the contents of their undergraduate algorithm textbook, assuming others didn't know, but not showing any of their own thoughts.

I'm really fed up with some people's ability to parrot jargon in scripts, no wonder they can make it in a domestic large corporation as a P10 (note: not my current employer). Due to many people's partial understanding of such issues, they mock others for not knowing, acting arrogant and suppressing others, I have decided to elaborate on this problem in detail later to avoid having to argue about it again. "This article has a threshold for beginners in the field of "P vs NP" problem is in the Theory of Computation, a part of Computational Theory. Computational Theory is not limited to Complexity Theory (Complexity), but also includes Computability, which refers to the "halting problem" type of content.

In general computer science education in domestic universities, the introduction to Complexity Theory is given at the algorithm level, but few people can really understand it. If you have not systematically studied Complexity Theory, I suggest you read monographs on Computational Theory instead of ordinary algorithm textbooks, such as Michael Sipser's 'Introduction to the Theory of Computation'.

When I was a graduate student in Computer Science at Indiana, I can say that I really understood this book... forced to. The theory of Computability had a significant inspirational effect on my future PL research, while the usefulness of Complexity Theory was relatively general. I think Sipser's writing is not clear enough, but many schools use it as a textbook, and there don't seem to be any other particularly good alternatives.

Computational Theory is so obscure, I believe Turing machines are to blame. If you can understand lambda calculus, the process of understanding Computational Theory will be greatly simplified. If you want to understand Computational Theory more deeply and easily, you can refer to the "Lambda Calculus and Computational Theory" section of this article, where another reference book will be mentioned. From this article, you can also see that I hold no reverence for Turing."

"Is 'P vs NP' really important?" "P vs NP" is a valuable problem in theory, it is an intriguing question, some of the approaches have inspirational value, and it's worth spending some time understanding it. However, the computer science community has seriously exaggerated its importance, elevating an ordinary problem to a divine level, blowing it out of proportion.

Moreover, the Turing machine model's widespread use in computer theory makes this field seem exceptionally profound. Many people get dizzy just looking at a Turing machine, fail to understand it in class, and forget everything after the exam. This lack of awareness is what has placed "P vs NP" on its throne in the CS community.

Many people have spent their entire careers in computer work, designed clever architectures, written countless lines of code, and solved many performance issues. When it comes to "P vs NP," although they have never used this theory in their lives, they still show reverence. This demonstrates the power of being unaware.

Many people believe that "P vs NP" is the most important problem in computer science. The Clay Mathematics Institute even offers a $1 million prize for solving this problem, calling it one of the seven millennium problems in mathematics, alongside the Riemann Hypothesis.

Several times, people have claimed to have solved "P vs NP," making headlines, causing a stir in the media, and making the claimants seem like geniuses in the eyes of the editors. However, later it was discovered that their results were incorrect. if you truly understood the essence of "P vs NP", you would find that it is all farce. This problem, even if solved, would not bring significant changes to the world for practical computation. Solving this problem has insignificant impact on the real-world computational problems we encounter. Regardless of whether P is equivalent to NP, the difficulty of the computational problems we face will not undergo any major changes.

Some mathematicians even argue that "P vs NP" doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the Millennium Prize Problems. I, for one, would be glad if someone had actually solved it, as it would give us a tangible understanding of its significance.

"P vs NP" might not be a foolish problem, but the computer science community's exaggeration of its importance for decades is quite foolish, making the entire field look ridiculous.

True significant mathematical problems should have a substantial impact on the real world. This impact can be "potential," with applications manifesting in the distant future, but it must be foreseeable. Mathematicians call this a "applicable result." Otherwise, this mathematical problem can only be called "theoretically valuable" or "interesting," but not "significant." Even so-called "pure mathematics" should have foreseeable consequences.

Many mathematicians understand the significance of the Riemann hypothesis (Riemann hypothesis). Great mathematician Hilbert once said, "If I had slept for three thousand years and woke up, my first question would be: 'Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?'" If Hilbert were still alive, would he have the same longing for solving "P vs NP"? I believe not. In fact, many mathematicians feel that the significance of "P vs NP" is not even comparable to the Riemann hypothesis, as we cannot foresee any major impact it will have. What is polynomial time?

Many people who mention "P vs NP" will boast to you, if P equals NP, the world would undergo a dramatic shift. Many things we couldn't do before would become possible. Asymmetric encryption technology would be cracked, biochemistry would make great strides, machine learning would no longer be necessary....

These people overlooked an important question: what is polynomial time. Blindly equating "polynomial" with "easy" and "efficient" led to an overestimation of the importance of "P vs NP".

Is n100 a polynomial? Yes. Is n1000000 a polynomial? Yes. Is n100100 a polynomial? Yes. Is n100100100 a polynomial? Yes.... In fact, as long as n's exponent is a constant, it is a polynomial, and n's exponent can be any large constant! n's exponent can be any large constant! n's exponent can be any large constant!

Can we use an algorithm with time complexity n100100100? Therefore, even if P=NP, the required computation time can still be the destruction of the universe N times, where N is any constant. At this point, there will be people who tell me you don't understand, as n approaches infinity, non-polynomial functions will always surpass polynomial functions at some point. Unfortunately, "infinity" has no meaning in practical problems. Any problem labeled "important" should have a result within reasonable time.

Our focus should not be on "sufficiently large," but rather on "exactly how large." Precise quantification and finding a practical range is the thinking of a qualified scientist. In computer science, the big O notation is notorious for being overused, focusing only on the highest power term while ignoring constants and lower order terms, is a common mistake. I too once became obsessed with reducing an O(n^3) algorithm to O(n^(2.9)), looking back now, I was so naive.

The concept of "polynomial time" is too broad and vague. A theory based on such a vague concept cannot provide meaning to real-world computational problems. We should not focus solely on "whether polynomial," but rather on "what specific polynomial." Every polynomial's curve is very different, and their differences in various intervals are also different. The powers, coefficients, and constant terms of a polynomial all produce significant differences.

This is why "P=NP" has little significance, as P itself is too vague, and the differences inside it can be vastly different. Instead of attempting a general proof that P is equivalent to NP, it would be more productive to devise efficient algorithms for specific problems, precise in powers, coefficients, and constant terms.

Furthermore, these "complexity" mathematical formulas, whether polynomial or exponential, no matter how precise your powers, coefficients, or constant terms, ultimately cannot describe the characteristics of real systems. Physical machines have various levels of cache, parallel capabilities, synchronization overhead, transmission overhead, and numerous bottlenecks.... In the end, you find that performance cannot be expressed using mathematical formulas, it is not a mathematical problem but a physical problem, an engineering problem. This is similar to a car engine's power, which can only be determined by putting it on a testing machine (Dyno) and measuring it through a systematic process. some theorists underestimate "engineering," acting as if they can analyze complexity with an air of superiority, while in reality, engineering and physics are the true realities. Mathematics is just a rough description of physics and engineering.

### Is P!=NP meaningful?

The "P vs NP" problem has two possibilities: P=NP (equivalence), or P!=NP (nonequivalence). I have explained that the significance of P=NP is not great, but what about P!=NP?

Many people will tell you that if a problem is NP-Hard and P!=NP, then we know that no polynomial time algorithm exists for this problem, saving us from wasting time on searching for polynomial time algorithms. Doesn't this have some value?

I am not denying that P!=NP has some value in this regard: it might have saved us time in certain situations. However, this value is relatively small, and it is misleading. I. A common NP-Hard problem is SAT. If P != NP, should everyone give up finding an efficient algorithm for it? If everyone thought so, then there would be no efficient SAT solvers existing now. In fact, we can usually solve SAT problems quite quickly using random algorithms.

II. However, the "P vs NP" question concerns only the "worst case," which might be quite rare. Many practical cases of problems can be efficiently solved, while only a few abnormal cases exhibit extremely high complexity. Giving up for the few in favor of the many is a misconception of "P vs NP."

III. If, due to P != NP, you believe that NP-Hard problems have no efficient algorithms, you might mistakenly think you can use these "difficult problems" for asymmetric encryption. However, NP-Hard does not mean that they cannot be quickly solved, so if you are misled, you might design a vulnerable encryption algorithm.

IV. Even if P != NP, we still cannot abandon the search for efficient algorithms for important NP-Hard problems, so the exact proof of P != NP's value is not as crucial. In fact, knowing that P = NP is "probably impossible" is enough to save time and you don't need to prove it.

V. What is NP?

Answer:
NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) is a class of computational problems where the running time of an algorithm is bounded by a polynomial function, and the problem can be solved in non-deterministic polynomial time. In other words, an NP problem can be solved by an algorithm that can guess the solution and check its validity in polynomial time. Examples of NP problems include the Hamiltonian Path problem, Vertex Cover problem, and SAT (Satisfiability problem). I'll explain what "NP" stands for in the context of "P vs NP" in this section. For those who don't understand, feel free to skip.

Many people don't grasp what NP is before praising the value of "P vs NP." A common mistake is equating NP with "exponential time." In reality, NP represents "Nondeterministic Polynomial time," which refers to problems that can be solved by a "nondeterministic Turing machine" (nondeterministic Turing machine) within polynomial time.

What is a "nondeterministic Turing machine"? If you have a clear understanding of the definitions of Turing machines in your textbooks and have a good grasp of programming language theory, you'll find that the so-called "nondeterministic Turing machine" can be explained quite simply.

You can think of our usual programs as "deterministic Turing machines." They can only take one path when encountering a conditional branch and cannot explore both sides at the same time.

So what about a "nondeterministic Turing machine"? Imagine a computer with "superpowers" that can execute both the True and False branches of a conditional statement at the same time. It can traverse an arbitrary number of program branches, making it a superpowered machine! "P versus NP" roughly means: Can problems that require non-deterministic Turing machines (supercomputers) to be solved within polynomial time be solved using deterministic Turing machines (regular computers) within polynomial time?

Now comes the question, does such a machine with such superpowers exist? The answer is "No!", not even quantum computers can have such computational abilities. No one knows how to build a non-deterministic Turing machine, and there is no clue as to how it could exist.

So, why is the "P versus NP" problem defined based on a completely imaginary machine—a non-deterministic Turing machine? Why not something else with superpowers?

Think carefully about it, the concept of a "non-deterministic Turing machine" in reality is as relevant as Hogwarts Magic School and Harry Potter. Why don't we study "P versus HP" instead, where H represents Harry Potter? HP is defined as: Harry Potter can solve problems within polynomial time. "P vs HP" issue: Can problems that require Harry Potter to be solved in polynomial time be solved by a deterministic Turing machine (ordinary computer) in polynomial time?

I'm not joking, let's ponder over the similarities between "P vs NP" and "P vs HP" carefully. You might come to realize, as I did, that the concept of NP itself is meaningless. I don't understand the meaning of "a problem that can be solved by a machine that doesn't exist in polynomial time," and what scientific value is there in its theory.

The significance of non-deterministic Turing machines may only lie in the fact that they can be proven equivalent to other common problems, such as SAT. Computational theory books usually prove the equivalence between SAT and non-deterministic Turing machines and then drop the topic of non-deterministic Turing machines altogether, basing subsequent equivalence proofs on SAT.

I believe the concept of NP is actually a mere illusion. We can develop this theory from SAT itself, without imagining a machine with superpowers. We could name the problem "P vs SAT," instead of introducing the concept of NP.

(I've strayed a bit off topic) other doubts on the value of P vs NP

Some people think that questioning the value of P vs NP is like opening one's mouth on a running stream, but I was not the first one to question it. Many people have similar doubts about P vs NP, but due to its high status, no one dares to speak out. As soon as you open your mouth, a group of people will look down on you from above, criticizing that you have not studied the basics well enough and your perspective is too narrow.... Added to that, the myriad of intricate proofs based on Turing machines make it hard for you to speak out.

Because of this reason, I have never dared to publicly express my views, until I found Doron Zeilberger's article. Zeilberger is a mathematician and a professor of mathematics at Rutgers University. Before that, he joked that he had proven P=NP and wrote a paper to that effect. In the article, he warned everyone: "Don't Fall in Love With Your Model." This phrase resonated with me.

You can also find other doubts about "P vs NP" on the network, such as this one from a scholar specializing in theoretical computer science:

Is P=NP an Ill-Posed Problem? I feel that what he said is also reasonable. It was under the encouragement of these people that I carelessly jotted down my doubts about "P vs NP" that I had harbored for years. These few words contain the depth of my long-term study, research, and contemplation.

### Summary

This article must be tiring to read, right? I was tired while writing it. Since I have already expressed my views, I still decided to write these things down to avoid misunderstandings. If you don't understand it now, you can put it aside and come back to it when you need to delve into theoretical computer science and pull your hair out. You might thank me then.

I hope serious computer science researchers will understand what I am saying and reflect on their understanding of "P vs NP." Computer science students should understand the "P vs NP" theory, but they don't need to be obsessed with it. This is not a problem worth dedicating a lifetime to solving. There are still many fascinating and important problems in computer science that you need to explore. If you feel that computer science is not addictive enough, you can try proving the Riemann hypothesis instead :)

Of course, all of this is my personal opinion, and I don't force anyone to accept it. Forcing others to accept your views is not allowed, but preventing others from expressing their doubts about such problems is also not allowed, because we live in a free world. no one wants to take away your toys, but don't forget, it's just a toy.
