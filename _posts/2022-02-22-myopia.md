1. Preventing and reversing nearsightedness is a relatively simple matter, understanding the principles requires only high school optics knowledge, and the specific methods only require an additional pair of glasses.
2. To reverse nearsightedness, just do this: adjust the focus length of your glasses to a distance beyond the point where you usually see clearly. 1. Wear glasses that are prescription 100 degrees weaker than yours. Wearing this pair of glasses, the visual effect is similar to that of a nearsighted person by 100 degrees, with little impact on daily life. After that, continue to wear these glasses for daily life, there is no need to do anything special.

2. Several months later, you will find that your vision improves and the degree reduces. When the degree reduces by about 50 degrees, go get a new lens, keep the difference from the actual degree at 100 degrees. Repeat this cycle until the vision recovers to 1.0.

For those who are not interested, you can stop here. But if you don't believe it's that simple and want to know the principle of this method, please continue reading.

### The Secret of External Eye Muscles

The cause of myopia lies in the external eye muscles. There are six precise muscles outside the eye (four rectus muscles, two oblique muscles). Many people think that these external muscles only serve to rotate the eyeball, but a century ago, there was an ophthalmologist named W. H. Bates who discovered through experiments on animal eyes that these muscles can also change the shape of the eyeball and perform precise focusing operations. From the picture, we can see that the two oblique muscles encircling the sides of the eyeball can generate sideways pressure together, compressing the eyeball to make it longer. At the same time, the four straight muscles contracting backward can make the eyeball shorter. Bates' experiments (by electrically stimulating these muscles) have shown this phenomenon. In the interaction of these six muscles, the eyeball is constantly changing shape.

It is generally believed that the human eye only uses the rectus muscle to change the shape of the crystalline lens for focusing, but in fact, the external muscles also participate in this operation. They change the shape of the eyeball (change the length of the optical axis) for focusing. You can think of the eyeball as a camera with an active negative, which can focus by changing the focal length of the lens (crystalline lens) and by changing the position of the negative (retina) at the same time.

Compared to the focusing range of the crystalline lens, changing the shape of the eyeball can only achieve a small change. Perhaps we can think of the crystalline lens as performing "rough focusing," and the external muscles changing the shape of the eyeball are performing "precise focusing." Since the external muscles can change the shape of the eyeball, they play a key role in the formation and correction of myopia.

### The principle of myopia formation

When looking at close objects, if the eyeball is completely relaxed, the image will fall behind the retina. To see clearly, the crystalline lens needs to be compressed, increasing its convexity. At the same time, the shape of the eyeball may also be slightly elongated by the external muscles, allowing the image to fall exactly on the retina. Prolonged near work can cause the eyeball to remain in a sustained elongated state. Maintaining this shape for a long time, the optical axis becomes longer, and it cannot return to normal when looking at distant objects, resulting in myopia.: The reason for myopia (nearsightedness) is not directly related to light or genetics, but rather the result of prolonged staring at near objects (such as books, phones, computers). The lens elongates over time, making it easier for the focusing muscle to see nearby objects without strain. Myopia is a feature of animal eyes, not a bug. The elongated lens makes it easier for us to see up close, an adaptation to our environment. Who's to blame you for looking close up so much?

Many people believe that a child's myopia is "pseudo-myopia," caused by muscle tension and not a true eye shape change. They seek out various methods to treat pseudo-myopia. However, a child's myopia is also due to an elongated lens, making it true myopia. All the so-called pseudo-myopia treatment methods are ineffective. I believe the term "pseudo-myopia" is just a pseudoscientific term for ineffective products.

### The "Myopia Gene"

Some people claim they have "good genes," seemingly unable to develop myopia despite overusing their eyes. However, I have found that these people have a unique eye usage pattern. Although it appears they are constantly looking close up, their eyes are actually in a "seeming to look but not really" relaxed state, not focused on nearby objects, but rather on some point behind the screen or a small point on the screen. In this case, the crystalline lens is actually relaxed, and the eyes are not stretched, yet they do not develop myopia because they are not truly focusing on nearby objects. This eye usage pattern is introduced in Bates' book and is called "Central Fixation."

Therefore, I feel that this so-called "non-myopic gene" might not be a physical genetic trait but rather a psychological and habitual "legacy." Parental education and lifestyle are passed down to children, resulting in good habits and no myopia. Conversely, "scholarly families," where parents read a lot and children follow suit, result in myopia and the belief that it is genetic.: The relationship between dioptric power and "clear range"

If you have myopia and don't wear glasses, it's difficult for your dioptric power to exceed 300 degrees. It usually stops developing around 200 degrees. The reason is that the eyesight of 200 degrees myopia is relaxed enough to clearly see objects at a distance of 0.5 meters. This 0.5 meter distance is called the "clear range" of 200 degrees myopia, and objects within this distance can be clearly seen by a person with 200 degrees myopia. Why do I know it's 0.5 meters? The formula is as follows:

100 / Dioptric power = Maximum clear distance (in meters)

Exercise: Based on this formula, how far can a person with 300 degrees myopia clearly see objects?

According to this formula, you can also estimate the dioptric power required to produce a certain degree of myopia by determining how close an object needs to be seen clearly. For example, the eyes need to produce a 200 degree myopia to clearly see an object at a distance of 0.5 meters when completely relaxed. Therefore, continuously looking at objects closer than 0.5 meters (or further) can cause myopia that does not exceed 200 degrees. Looking at objects within 0.5m, one generally needs to bend waist and curve back, which makes one uncomfortable and adjusts back. Therefore, if a person doesn't wear glasses, it is quite difficult to exceed 300 degrees of nearsightedness.

### Preventing Nearsightedness

The cause of myopia (nearsightedness) is usually due to wearing full prescription or excessively corrected glasses to look at close objects. The myopic eyes find it easier to look at close objects without glasses, the ciliary muscle doesn't have to work hard, so if one doesn't wear glasses when looking close, myopia doesn't develop significantly. However, when wearing full prescription glasses, this ease of looking close is counteracted, the ciliary muscle still needs to work hard to achieve the required convergence, and the external muscles continue to lengthen the eyeball axis, resulting in the myopia becoming deeper. Then, another eye exam is taken, and new prescription glasses are obtained, and the vicious cycle continues....

Therefore, for those with myopia, glasses should not be over-prescribed with a 1.0 diopter, and daily glasses should at least be reduced by 25 diopters from the 1.0 diopter base.

If myopia has already occurred, and the prescription is not over 200 degrees, then one should avoid wearing glasses when looking close, as wearing full prescription glasses when looking close is the root cause of myopia deepening. However, glasses should be worn when looking far. Additionally, pay attention to the reading distance and keep it at a reasonable distance to prevent myopia from developing further. Why do optometrists and eyeglass stores tell you to get the correct diopters, otherwise your nearsightedness will worsen? Because their business gets better the more nearsighted you are ;)

### Principle of Myopia Reversal

The natural reversal of myopia relies on "far sight." Please note that the "far" here is quoted.

First, let me explain what "far sight" means here. The "far" in this context does not refer to a fixed distance, but rather to the position of the object in the eyeball. If the lens is completely relaxed and the image still falls in front of the retina (as shown in the figure), for human vision, this is considered "far." For a person with 1.0 visual acuity, anything beyond 6 meters can be considered "far," for a person with 100 degrees of myopia, 100/100 = 1 meter is considered "far," and for a person with 500 degrees of myopia, 100/500 = 0.2 meters can be considered "far."

When looking at a distant object, the lens needs to relax and reduce convergence. If the lens is completely relaxed and the image still falls in front of the retina, the object cannot be seen clearly. If you continue to look at the blurry object, the extraocular muscles around the eye will start to lightly compress the eyeball, making the visual axis slightly shorter (perhaps only 0.x millimeters), and the blurry object will gradually become clearer. If you often stay in this blurry state and the visual axis repeatedly contracts slightly, it will lead to a permanent shortening of the visual axis, resulting in myopia reversal.: The key to reversing nearsightedness lies in frequently being in a state where objects are somewhat blurry beyond the clear range. The objects do not necessarily have to be very far, just outside the clear range is sufficient. For instance, if you have 200 degrees of nearsightedness, then you can achieve the effect of reversing nearsightedness by not wearing glasses when looking at objects that are 0.5m or farther away.

Note that this requires a habitual operation, ideally unconscious and natural, becoming a habit. Deliberately setting aside time every day to "practice" often yields poor results. Also, remember to look at objects naturally, without straining to see them or staring at them for too long, which is bad for the eyes. Gently look at "far" objects, and your eyes will adjust naturally.

### Methods for Reversing Nearsightedness

Now that we understand the principle, let's look at how to actually do it.

The simplest and most crude method for reversing nearsightedness is to not wear glasses at all. A 18-year-old young man, who originally had over 600 degrees of nearsightedness, started not wearing glasses in his daily life (except when necessary to see far away objects), and after three months, his degree of nearsightedness decreased by about 100 degrees. I. For people with high myopia who don't wear glasses, life can be quite painful, so I suggest wearing "low degree number glasses" as a more moderate approach. The method is as follows: if you are myopic by 600 degrees, reduce the glass degree by 100 degrees and get a pair of 500 degree glasses, keeping the scattering the same. Wearing these glasses makes the observable scene similar to that of a person with a 100 degree myopia, who suffers little impact on daily life.

II. The clear range of a 100 degree myopic eye is 1m. Therefore, for objects beyond 1m, the reversal effect of myopia is achieved. The effect of these glasses is to lower the distance considered "far," making the wearing of full-degree number glasses "near," and making many things that were "far" become "near," thereby significantly increasing the opportunities to see far.

III. Therefore, wear a pair of glasses with a reduced degree by 100, and wear them regularly. After a few months, the myopia degree should decrease slightly. If you notice a significant improvement in clarity, it is likely that a reduction of 50 degrees has been made. Go for a refraction test and get a pair of glasses with a lower degree number to maintain a difference of 100 degrees with the actual degree. This virtuous cycle continues...

IV. However, wearing glasses with a reduction of 100 degrees for computer use may be too clear, so if you want to see results more quickly, you can also wear a pair of glasses with a reduction of 150 degrees. Wear the glasses with a reduction of 100 degrees for outdoor use and wear the glasses with a reduction of 150 degrees for computer use, placing the screen at a slightly blurry distance of 0.66m (100/150) beyond the usual viewing distance. The longer you use the computer, the better your vision will become. However, I do not recommend focusing too hard on every character, allowing them to remain blurry, and taking regular breaks to rest.

V. Lastly, be aware that the font size on the screen should not be set too large. Many people mistakenly believe that large font sizes protect vision, but in fact, the opposite is true. Large font sizes have a larger viewing angle, making it seem like you're looking at a closer object. Set the screen font size to normal or slightly smaller, reducing the viewing angle, making it seem like you're looking at a farther object. Over time, your vision will improve.: Because the brain always chooses the image from the eye with better vision, this method always makes the better-seeing eye even better. If the difference in vision between the two eyes is significant, it will lead to an imbalance. If the difference in vision is over 50 degrees, glasses are required to make the vision of both eyes more even.

This method is slow, do not rush for success. Considering how long your nearsightedness has been developing, the reversal process will not be quick. Three months to reverse 25 degrees is good, reducing 100 degrees per year. Because the muscles are quietly exerting force on the eyeball, be careful not to strain too much. This is similar to the principle of not overdoing it in fitness. People over 40 years old should be especially careful, as the eye's crystalline lens starts to harden, and excessive strain may cause floaters. If you improve significantly in a short time, be cautious and take care not to damage your eyes!

I'm not sure this method is suitable for everyone. Although I believe that eyes should not be as rigid as commonly thought, and may have an age close to "settling down," beyond a certain age, reversal may be difficult or very slow. If there is no improvement after a year of trying, the eyes may have already settled.

### For high myopia degrees

Since high myopia can lead to serious problems like detachment of the retina, if it exceeds 800 degrees, it is best to go to the hospital for a retinal examination first, and only try with caution and in small doses if there are no issues. Do not strain too much. I. Low myopia degree

If you manage to reduce your myopia degree to 100 through the above methods, or if your myopia degree is originally low, below 100, wearing no glasses will make it difficult to recover to 1.0 visual acuity. This is because the eye shape change caused by external muscles is too small when the degree is too low, making it hard to sustain a change.

For low myopia degree cases, wearing old glasses can be an option. For instance, if your myopia is 100 degrees, you can buy a 50 degree old glass. Wearing it will result in a visual effect of 150 degrees, making objects further than 0.66m blurry. Wearing this old glass every day while looking at a screen will help reduce your myopia. Once it is reduced to a certain extent, you can buy a 100 or 150 degree old glass to wear, until you recover to 1.0 or even better visual acuity.

II. Convenient visual acuity assessment method

How can you easily tell if there is any improvement after a certain period of time? You can't go to the optometrist every few days and it's not convenient to have an eye chart at home. A simple method is to choose a reference object in a place where you often sit, preferably with clear text on it. For example, I like to sit on the sofa and look at the Marshall speaker logo on the TV cabinet. Based on its clarity, I can determine if my vision has improved. if you want to be more precise, you can use a piece of paper with characters and a steel ruler, measure the distance each eye can clearly see with the ruler. Then, using the formula "myopia degree = 100/clear distance," you can get an approximate degree. Or you can just remember the distance you can see clearly and use it as a comparison base.

I don't recommend frequently performing this kind of measurement, as the improvement process is very slow and may have ups and downs, so frequent measurements may lead to disappointment. It's best to go with the flow and test after a certain period of time, which may bring a pleasant surprise.

### Natural is important

Compared to my completely "wu wei" natural vision recovery method, there are several other methods circulating on the internet, such as those of the EndMyopia type. These methods generally require you to do specific things, such as spending a lot of time on "Active Focus" type exercises. Some methods require you to stare intensely at distant objects, or even not blink and continue to look until tears flow and endure the pain. Some require using "3D stereoscopic images" for "cross-eyed" exercises, and exaggerate the rate of improvement.

These methods make people believe that they must do something, must strictly follow their instructions, in order to be effective, but they don't fully understand the principles of myopia reversal. I also tried some of these exercises for a short time, but I later found that they were not using their eyes naturally and could cause serious tension, even eye injury. In the end, I found that no special exercises were needed, only wearing glasses with a lower prescription was sufficient.1. This type of practice seems "natural," but it might be quite dangerous. The eyes are living tissue with elasticity, not like dough that can be molded at will. They cannot change their shape permanently in a short time and may be injured. Pain is a very important signal, it tells you to stop harming yourself. Ignoring the pain signal may result in injury. Therefore, I do not recommend any methods that cause discomfort to the eyes. I don't believe in those who advocate "endure the pain and persist, victory is achieved." Be aware that this world is full of swindlers, they might be trying to harm you.

2. Although my method only involves wearing glasses besides natural eye use, there is still a possibility of discomfort or pain due to low lens power, prolonged use, or excessive ambition. Therefore, I suggest that when discomfort or unusual tension occurs, stop immediately, rest fully. If the discomfort persists after multiple attempts, consider slightly increasing the lens power, such as reducing it by 75 degrees or 50 degrees, until the discomfort disappears and returns to normal, then continue trying.

3. Although you know you should "use your eyes naturally," this thing still has some purpose in it, so some people may unconsciously overuse their eyes or force themselves to do things. I have summarized some signals that remind you that you are doing something you shouldn't:

- Eyes or eye sockets, sun cavities, or eyeballs have a sour taste
- Vision becomes blurry, things that were previously clear are now unclear.1. seeing double
2. slowing down focusing speed of eyes
3. appearing mosquitoes

If you encounter the above situations, you should stop and rest. If the above phenomena often occur, you should check your methods. For example, are you forcing your eyes to see clear things that are too far or too blurry? Are you staring at one place for too long? Are you forgetting to blink? Are you straining to see far without looking near? etc.
