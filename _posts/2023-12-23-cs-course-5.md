Computing Science Fundamentals Class (5th period, Real-world Track) Enrollment

The Computing Science Fundamentals Class is a course designed for those with no prior knowledge, aiming to master the essence of Computing Science in a short period. It is the result of over 20 years of academic and engineering practice in Computing, combined with two years of experimental teaching to the society. The course draws on the best points of major computer introductory teaching methods worldwide, avoiding the problems that hinder beginners' understanding, enabling students with no prior knowledge to master advanced content within just two months. These contents provide a solid foundation, making it easier for them to understand other aspects of Computing Science.

The 4th period Basic Class was held after May 2021, and no Basic Class has been conducted since then. After the successful completion of the Advanced Class, Continuation Class, and Concurrent Computing Special Class, I have decided to conduct another round of starting-from-scratch Basic Class. Welcome to apply.

Compared to the previous batches, I will add some "real-world attachment" content in this course. Through several popular languages' features, we will grasp the concepts applicable to practical engineering. The "attachment languages" are initially planned to include Python, Java, and Rust. By understanding them, we will master "object-oriented", "static type systems", and "memory management" concepts, among others.

Therefore, this period's Basic Class not only builds a solid "recursion" foundation and delves into deep "interpreter" content, but also makes it easier to apply these essential concepts to real-world engineering. Course Method

- The course is conducted through Zoom video conferencing for teaching.

- One class per week, approximately 2 hours.

- There is a weekly free discussion session for students to clarify doubts.

- Each student will be added to their own tutoring group, where experienced teaching assistants will provide guidance, and I will supervise and guide to ensure students do not get stuck in unnecessary stages.- Students are added to the fifth basic class group in the student council to facilitate communication among students.

### Applicable Audience

- Students from middle school to doctoral level in various majors, whether they are humanities or sciences students, can learn it. Previous courses have successfully helped a [13-year-old boy](http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2021/09/16/youth-cs-student) master these contents deeply and even surpassed many experienced adult students.

- Employed personnel, including IT professionals, IT management personnel, and other engineering workers.

- Other types of people interested in computers. Fees and Registration:

- Fees are uniformly set at 12,800 per person.

- To register, please send an email to yinwang.advising@icloud.com with the subject line "Registration for Computer Science Foundation Program 5th Period". In the email, please provide your basic information, attach a resume, and include your WeChat contact details. Please write a 200-character statement about yourself, explaining your motivation for learning. Qualified applicants will undergo a brief WeChat voice interview.

Start Date:

The course is scheduled to begin in January 2024, with specific dates to be determined based on registration numbers. The course may take short breaks during holidays such as Chinese New Year.1. Introduction to JavaScript (Course begins with JavaScript as teaching language due to its ease of use and widespread application. However, the course is not about teaching JavaScript itself, but rather the concepts do not depend on any specific feature of JavaScript. To help students transition to real-world programming, this period's course will include three other "real languages" at the end. Tentative plan includes Python, Java, and Rust.)

18. Weekly Tutoring Sessions (One session for each language) 1st lesson: Functions. Different from general courses, this course doesn't start with the "Hello World" program or ask students to do seemingly fun but actually boring small games. I directly talk about the core content: functions. There are only a few key points about functions, but they are the core of everything. Repeating the practice of these few points allows the brain to think freely about them, which is the essence of teaching. I designed appropriate exercises for each knowledge point.

The exercises for the 1st lesson are all small, only requiring one or two lines of code, yet they contain profound principles. The exercises gradually increase in difficulty, surpassing the level of doctoral courses. I renamed all the terms to prevent students from searching related content online, so their thinking is not influenced by any existing information, allowing them to independently complete these exercises. Each exercise builds upon the previous one, and the following exercises do not require any other prerequisites. Interestingly, with proper guidance, some students were able to complete the most difficult exercises, even those with no prior knowledge. Specific content is not disclosed for confidentiality reasons.

2nd lesson: Recursion. Recursion is arguably the most important concept in computer science (or mathematics). I started with the simplest recursive function to understand the essence of recursion and master the systematic thinking approach to recursion.

Recursion is a concept that many people believe they understand, but in reality, they have been misled by inadequate teaching methods. Many people mention recursion and only think of "Tower of Hanoi" or "Eight Queens" problems, but they cannot apply it to solve real-world problems. Many programming books emphasize the "disadvantages" of recursion and teach students how to "eliminate recursion," but they fail to address the root cause—early implementations of function calls in certain languages (such as C) were incorrect and inefficient, leading students to be taught to avoid recursion. Since they never truly grasped the recursive thinking approach, when they encounter complex recursive functions in their future work, they feel baffled.

3rd lesson: Linked Lists. Starting from scratch, students do not rely on any language features, and implement the most basic data structure: a linked list. Students will implement numerous functions to operate on linked lists during practice. These functions have been carefully selected and arranged, many of which are basic functions in functional programming languages, but students master the recursive systematic thinking approach by writing them independently. This enables them to think freely about this type of data structure and solve new recursive problems.: Differing from general data structure courses, this course focuses mainly on "functional data structures." These structures have certain unique and useful properties due to their logical structure, making them easier to understand compared to traditional data structure books. Unlike the Haskell community's teaching style, I will not dogmatically emphasize the benefits of pure functions but instead objectively help students understand their advantages and discover their weaknesses. Once you learn these structures, it will be easier to extend them to non-functional structures, seamlessly combining the two styles.

4th Lesson: Trees. Extending from linked lists to more complex data structures, trees. Trees are one of the most common and essential data structures in computer science, so understanding tree operations is important. Our trees are all pure functional.

5th Lesson: Calculator. After getting familiar with tree basic operations, implement a rather advanced calculator capable of calculating any nested arithmetic expressions. Arithmetic expressions are a type of "expression tree." From this exercise, students will understand the principle "expressions are a tree."

6th Lesson: Search Structures. Learn how to implement key-value search structures and personally implement two important search data structures. Our search structures are all functional data structures. These structures will play a big role in later interpreters, deepening students' understanding.

7th Lesson: Interpreter. Building on the foundation laid earlier, personally implement the essential yet often misunderstood concept in computer science—interpreters. Interpreters are crucial for understanding various computer science concepts, such as programming languages, operating systems, databases, network protocols, and web frameworks. The computer's most fundamental component, the CPU, is essentially an interpreter. Understanding interpreters will help you grasp "computer system architecture," or the "hardware." You'll find that this hardware is not significantly different from software. Interpreters can be considered "computation itself," making them worthwhile to study. A deep understanding of interpreters will also aid in understanding various other subjects, such as natural language processing, logic. 8th lesson: Python. Use Python language to explain the concept of "object-oriented programming". Python was used in this lesson to bridge the gap between the ideas learned earlier and "real programming", helping students understand how the concepts learned can be applied to real-world coding. This lesson will also cover the basic usage of other command-line languages such as arrays, assignment, loops, etc.

Python may be the most popular language now due to the "AI craze". I don't care about AI, but Python is a good choice as a tool to understand "object-oriented programming". Even if some people, like me, don't care about "object-oriented", understanding other people's concepts of "object-oriented programming" is helpful for practical work, otherwise you will have a hard time understanding such code.

9th lesson: Java. Use Java language to introduce the "static type system" as an essential tool for creating large-scale projects and ensuring basic quality. Through Java's type system, students will master the basic static type checking rules and important concepts such as generics. This foundation will prepare students for other similar languages like C++, C#, Rust, etc.

Java may be criticized by "functional programmers" for being too complex, but once you master the essential programming techniques, you can write simple and high-quality code with Java. Java is still the most widely used language in the web server domain and is the most reliable language relative to others.

10th lesson: Rust. Rust is the hottest new emerging language, but most of its features have already existed in other languages, Rust just selects the best parts and includes some of its own design errors. Rust's unique feature is "static memory management", which means memory safety is ensured not through "garbage collection" (GC), but through the static type system. In this lesson, we will master the basics of memory management and understand Rust's unique concepts of ownership, lifetime, etc. If time permits, we will also use Rust to understand other important type system features. I have understood memory management through Rust, which will also help students understand C, C++ and other languages that have "manual memory management" completely. It lays a foundation for low-level system programming.
