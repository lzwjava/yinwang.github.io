title: "Interstellar"
---

I watched Interstellar over the weekend at the invitation of a friend. Given that it was only the second day after its premiere, the crowd was large and the tickets were pricier. Unfortunately, I found myself bored stiff within minutes, barely managing to endure the long three hours, and dozing off towards the end.

To my surprise, people were raving about it, with IMDB ratings reaching 9.0. I was in awe. Just as I was glad my appreciation level hadn't been swayed by Hollywood yet, I heard our department head was planning a team building activity â€“ "eight men collectively watching Interstellar." I couldn't help but laugh and call in sick that day :P

So why do I think Interstellar is a bad movie? Here's why:

1. The dialogue was heavy-handed and unnatural, with characters delivering long monologues that felt more like exposition than authentic conversation.
2. The plot was convoluted and confusing, with numerous plot holes and inconsistencies that left me questioning what I had just watched.
3. The special effects were impressive, but they couldn't save a weak storyline. The movie relied too heavily on spectacle rather than substance.
4. The emotional moments felt forced and manipulative, with little depth or nuance.
5. The pacing was uneven, with long, drawn-out scenes that seemed to go on forever, followed by rushed conclusions.

Overall, Interstellar left me feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. I prefer my science fiction to be thought-provoking and engaging, rather than a two-hour snooze fest. 1. Geeky and pedantic. The director seems to not consider himself a director, but Steven S. Spielberg, so the entire film is filled with him boasting about how much universe theory he knows. He forgot that a movie's main purpose is entertainment, and its value lies in its storytelling and dramatic elements. Physics, universe theory, spaceship terminology may look cool, but in reality, they turned the film into a tedious lecture. People who claim to like this movie are usually those who can brag about how much black hole theory they know.

2. Preaching and sentimental. "Love is a power that can transcend the universe, do you feel it?" This line comes out of nowhere, and Tang Seng recites it repeatedly. Love is beautiful and important, but its power and scope are limited. There's no need to force and exaggerate it like this? Moreover, this kind of emotional content is best expressed through the plot (compare it to good movies like "Life is Beautiful" or "City of Angels"). This straightforward, plain dialogue lacks impact and fails to achieve its intended effect. This reflects Hollywood's long-standing habit of "thought and moral education" for the masses, treating audiences like low-intelligence or even childish. This preachy tendency is most evident in Disney films, but it also runs through many Hollywood movies intended for adults.

3. Shallow theme, pursuing special effects superficially. A movie should have a theme, and all the scenes, special effects, should serve the theme. This film's theme seems to be about "love," but the scenes used to support the theme are forced and mundane, making it completely powerless to support its intended theme. "5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ignition!" The cool-looking spaceships and space suits, the main character's various poses in the cockpit, ... all look impressive? But these things can't hide the blandness of the plot. Instead, the shallow plot makes these high-tech models look like toys made of foam plastic. "Ready the big gun, level one..." Hollywood, please make more films for adults to watch.

4. Overly serious, too quiet, feels low-budget. The film contains a lot of monologues, and there are several scenes where two people are "having heart-to-heart talks." If these dialogues have good setup, they can be effective. However, this film didn't do a good job setting them up, so when they suddenly appear, they feel unnatural and unrealistic. The entire theater is quiet, and the audience is staring at each other, feeling uncomfortable and awkward. Many of the outer space scenes are completely silent, with no background sound effects, making it seem like the film lacked the budget to hire someone to do the music. The entire film feels "low-budget," almost like a few people talking in a room and using a computer to make special effects.

5. Serious logical inconsistencies. A physics and astronomy friend who watched this film was excited and applauded: "The physics and astronomy in this film, the black hole theory, there are no flaws!" However, this friend, who understands the deep principles of physics, lacks a crucial understanding, which is called "common sense." Common sense determines what a specific person should say or do in a specific situation. This film's characters have some very serious logical inconsistencies that make people laugh and cry. One example is when the copilot picks up a piece of paper and begins to explain what a wormhole is and how it works to the captain (main character), as if the captain, about to cross a wormhole for a mission, had no idea what a wormhole was. This is like someone starting to explain the runway length of an aircraft carrier to a pilot who has just taken off. No matter how clear the wormhole theory explanation is, this dialogue should not appear at that time, in that place, between those characters. The education provided on the screen is intended for the audience, not the characters. The audience in the theater, who are like children, will learn about wormholes in this way, wow... Some people who watch movies are very "rational" and track the "deep theories" described in the film, if they find no flaws and learn something, they feel it's a good film. Only when you step out of the "study physics, understand universe principles" thinking circle, will you realize how absurd and unreasonable the characters' behavior is. The film's characters have many more strange dialogues and actions waiting to be explored.: It's both stinky and long. If the story is bad, I can endure it for a couple of hours, but this one lasts for three hours! Therefore, I really cannot endure it any longer, I must spray something!

Lastly, regarding the academic issues of how the big water on the first planet can kill people and where the last female astronaut went to the stars, my scholarly friend expresses his reverent respect and heartfelt condolences. My definitive answer to such questions is: the arrangement of the director!
