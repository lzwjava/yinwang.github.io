I. Some bad habits in American English to be avoided

This article collects some "viruses" of American English that I mentioned recently on Weibo.

### Californian English intonation issue

Why do I recommend starting with machine learning by watching the cs231n videos from the 2016 winter quarter instead of the latest versions? The main reason is that Andrej Karpathy speaks better than the other two American kids. It's obvious that when other two people took over, I found myself not understanding many parts. It felt like they were just reading Karpathy's slides verbatim, without truly understanding. It felt like they were speaking to others while their minds were trembling.

Another thing I didn't mention is that I can't stand the English of those two American kids. One is white, the other is ABC. It's very typical Californian English, where every sentence ends in a rising intonation, and the intonation is floating throughout, never fully descending. It's like they're always asking questions or seeking opinions, but in reality, it's a declarative sentence.1. This tone is common in California, they seem to want to be cute, thinking that rising intonation can make people like them more. But this tone leaves the listener's heart hanging, not knowing when it will end. Moreover, it's too affected, and after listening for a long time, it feels very fake and unnatural. Californians, regardless of gender, have many such people.

2. I noticed from Karpathy's video that he is not like that. The ending of his declarative sentences is clearly lowered, giving a down-to-earth feeling. He is not a Californian, he is probably not even an American. Notice I'm not saying I like London accent. The name Andrej suggests he is from a Eastern European country near Russia.

3. When I was at IU, several professors were from European countries. They said their English was much clearer, neither American nor London accent. Dan Friedman, Kent Dybvig, ... did not have a noticeable American accent. My "formal advisor" Amr Sabry was from Egypt, of course, he would not have an American accent.

### Words to be removed

Californian English has a problem - they use a lot of unnecessary "mood words." I hate the word "like" the most. When Californians speak English, you will often hear "…… like，……" in the middle of a sentence, followed by a long pause. Sometimes there is no continuation after "like," it's all in the silence. There's also "It's like…" where you want to say something, but you have to add "It's like…" in front of it. Now every time I hear a sentence with a "like" in it, I can't stand it. Still another disliked colloquialism is "you know." In the middle of a sentence, adding "you know..." (you know...), then continuing. Sometimes a sentence contains several "you know"s, making one anxious. I've already known what you're going to say, yet you still say it. Meaningless, self-contradictory, seriously affecting language expression, just like chewing gum.

Additionally, some Californians like to use the words "cool" and "awesome." At the beginning, they all like to say "cool," which is a meaningless cliche. Regardless of whether one likes a thing or not, they immediately say "cool!" with an excited expression, trying to make you have a good impression of them. Later, they found that "cool" was used too much, the trick was exposed, and some people began to say "awesome." No matter what others say, one's own feelings aside, the first response is "awesome!" Gradually, "awesome" also lost its meaning.

I don't know what their next choice will be. In any case, they always have a mantra, used to conceal their lack of understanding of the content, clueless, pretending to love it.

You'll find that Karpathy doesn't use any such colloquialisms in his videos. If he can't remember a sentence halfway through, he'll pause, without any sound, no "you know," "like," or even "um," and once he remembers, he'll continue speaking, making the speech clear.

Garbage language is very contagious. When you hear friends speaking this way, you unconsciously learn it. The general psychology is: this way of speaking sounds more like an American, so others will look up to me. The inner insecurity leads Chinese children in America to easily learn these things easily. I truly hope that Chinese people living in California won't let their children learn these things. In English, the phrase "So..." is used in the middle of a sentence, followed by a sentence starting with "so," which indicates the condition or cause of the second sentence. For instance, "..., so we can..." (........, this way we can......). However, some people like to use "So,..." at the beginning of a sentence without any relevant cause or reason preceding it, leaving the audience unsure of what "So" refers to. Worse still, after saying "So," there may be a long pause, making the statement seem profound. Sometimes, multiple "So's" are used in quick succession, resulting in a repetitive "So So So..."

I have noticed that this phenomenon has spread to Chinese speakers as well, and has even been translated into Chinese. Some people start a sentence with "那么..." (nàmenò), but the preceding content has no relevance to the meaning of "那么...". This is the domestic version of the "English virus." A person recently spoke to me with an English sentence ending in 'right?'. I was taken aback. It wasn't just surprising to hear a Chinese person speak English with that, but also the 'right?' at the end.

In America, I often heard people speak like that, it seemed commonplace. After leaving America for a few years, I suddenly noticed it when I heard such a sentence again, and it gave me an uncomfortable feeling. This is quite intriguing.

Recently, I have been pondering problems with American English, and today I recalled this incident and carefully analyzed it, and even searched online for research. I discovered that this kind of 'right?' at the end is a question mark in a hidden language pattern.

Many people often hear 'right?' at the end of a sentence from those around them, and they themselves start to do the same, without realizing that it is a condescending, impolite, and disrespectful way of speaking. Over time, this language spreads like a virus, and we move further away from civilization. One statement with a 'right?' at the end means the speaker is stating something they believe and seeking confirmation from you. It's not asking a question or soliciting opinions, but rather seeking your acknowledgement of their statement. They expect your response to be verbal agreement or a nod.

In essence, 'right?' is used to make someone nod. Repeatedly saying 'right?' is repeatedly making someone nod. This is a condescending, subtle form of coercing others. Who keeps nodding non-stop to someone else? A servant.

This condescending language is commonly used in everyday conversation among many Americans. In America, many people speak this way. Originally, it should have been a question, such as:

Do you like football?
你喜欢足球吗？

Instead, they say:

You like football, right?
你喜欢足球，对吗？

Or:

It's hot today, right?
今天很热，对吗？

Or:

You're not going to believe this, right?
你真的不会相信这件事情，对吗？

This is a subtle form of manipulation and disrespect. It's important to be aware of this language and avoid using it, as it can create a power imbalance and undermine respectful communication. "You like football, right?" in English is "Do you like football?"

The second sentence pattern shows a condescending and arrogant tone because it appears to be asking a question but has already imposed a predetermined answer. For instance, in this example, it seems that the person assumes you like football, but you may not, and they are waiting for you to say 'right.' Perhaps they themselves like football so much that they believe everyone should, and they expect you to agree.

A regular question sentence has a 'yes or no?' at the end, but this kind of sentence has a 'right?' at the end, and it doesn't give you a 'no' option.

A regular question sentence allows you to answer 'yes' or 'no.' However, this 'right?' at the end implies: "I have already made up my mind, it is definitely this way, I expect the answer to be 'right,' you should say 'right,' don't say 'no,' I am waiting for you to say 'right,' you said 'right,' and I can continue." many times people say out 'right?' but don't wait for your answer before continuing, assuming your answer is 'right.' In other words, the person saying this phrase doesn't care about your answer. They have already decided the answer unilaterally and are only symbolically asking you "is that right?"

This is similar to a teacher who knows the answer to an exam question, asking a student. "This is how it is, isn't it?" "You know this, isn't it?" He is not asking you, not discussing, but only wanting to make sure you understand what he believes is definitely correct. Therefore, it shows a lack of respect, looking down.

When the police are recording a statement from you, stating something they know, and then say "Am I correct?" "Yes or no?" is better than 'right?' because they give you a chance to deny.

"On the 27th of April night at 11 pm, you went to this place. Am I correct?"

So, what feeling does 'right?' give people, you can sense it yourselves. In fact, I believe professional detectives cannot end with 'right?' Because the law gives you the right to say 'no,' he is forcing you to accept it, and can be reported for it. if 'right?' is a fact before it, it shows disrespect and self-centeredness. But if the fact before it is factually incorrect, you can't say 'right,' which shows the speaker's foolishness and self-righteousness.

Moreover, some Americans pronounce the 'right?' in 'right?' as 'rate?' with a flatter tone and smaller mouth, giving it a rural feel. Adding the hidden coercive meaning of this sentence structure, frequently using it makes one appear uneducated and of low quality.

My suggestion for everyone is: Chinese people should not use English in their daily language, except for academic terms. Moreover, when speaking English, one should stop using this kind of final 'right?'

### Using Clean Language
[End of Translation]: Of course, the common mistakes in American English are not just these, I've only pointed out some typical issues. These language phenomena in English should be avoided proactively, like the "net speak" in Chinese. Regardless of what language we use, we should pay attention to good style and not adopt bad habits just because those around us do. Only then will we become civilized people, and our society will be more comfortable.
