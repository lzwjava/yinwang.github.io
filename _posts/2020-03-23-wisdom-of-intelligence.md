title: "Doubts about intelligence"
---


I have been planning to write a "Newcomer's Guide" for some time now. On one hand, due to the existence of similar questions in consulting work and on Knowledge Star Platform. On the other hand, these questions resonated with me from my experience as a Ph.D. student at Tsinghua. Even at Cornell, these questions still lingered. No one answered these questions, everyone seemed so smart and learned effortlessly... Now that these questions have resurfaced, I realized how many people needed help.

Where should we start? Let's begin with "intelligence" and cognitive abilities. I wrote down the title "Doubts about IQ," I found it had a double meaning. The common meaning, as some students mentioned, was their doubts about their own IQ, fearing they were not as intelligent as certain "scholars," feeling they were inherently unable to think through difficult problems.

However, in my case, "Doubts about IQ" had a completely opposite meaning: I doubted the concept of "IQ," its scientific validity, the methods used to measure it, and all those who used IQ to make statements.

I found that people who doubted their own IQ had issues not with their IQ but with their doubts. The limitations of the human brain often stem from self-doubt. Normally, people can think logically and find answers, but when someone doubts their abilities, they cannot. The psychological drain of doubt consumed their thinking ability, causing a thinking paralysis.

I heard a story about a psychologist who hypnotized a strongman, making him believe he was paralyzed and unable to lift his arms. Guess what? Under hypnosis, he actually believed it and couldn't lift his arms. The power of belief is immense; if you don't believe in your ability to do something, you likely won't.

Many people wish you had this misconception, so they could appear smarter, more intelligent than you, and then collect your "IQ tax" from you. I'll be honest, I've had my doubts about my intelligence. After failing the college entrance exam, I went to a less than ideal university. I thought it should be quite easy there, but instead I found myself struggling to learn many things. My classmates would constantly compare us, saying things like "Your classmate X didn't get into Peking University and started programming in elementary school. You may have good grades, but you never touched a real computer before..." These comparisons left me feeling attacked.

During military training, I heard people endlessly discussing "Win 95," and when I asked what it was, I was told "Win 95 is an upgrade from DOS." I was still wondering what DOS was in my mind, but I didn't dare to ask and embarrass myself. My high school self-confidence was gradually erased. I found myself unable to understand every word I read, yet unable to grasp the meaning. I began to doubt my intelligence. Was I really unable to understand mathematics, algorithms, and computer-related problems? Were the intelligent students in high school just pretending? I was just a low-ability student, or maybe I was just good at high school subjects because they were too easy?

This situation continued until I graduated from university, even extending to my time at Cornell. The situation was more severe there, as I was surrounded by many self-proclaimed geniuses. Cornell had a few professors who were highly regarded at the time. I initially thought they were geniuses, but when I took their classes, I found them facing the blackboard, muttering to themselves, while students frantically took notes. I always ended up dropping the class, feeling lost and unable to keep up.

I thought I was the only underperforming, low-intelligence student, until I met another student who was also planning to drop the class. He was an Indian student. I was at my wit's end with the class, but no one seemed to understand my feelings. Fortunately, I ran into him leaving the classroom that day and asked him how he felt about the class. To my surprise, he didn't say "it's great," but instead shook his head: "Is this guy even teaching?" I finally realized I wasn't alone.

Later, in the face of constant criticism, I sought inspiration and discovered that they weren't true geniuses, but rather had been artificially inflated. The famous professors were popular back then because they researched "social networks," and at the time, Facebook was extremely popular. They could write research papers using some social network data, a little graph theory knowledge, and some Matlab code to make a graph, and publish top-tier journal papers. They could claim "six degrees of separation," even though it wasn't their idea, but you could say "I was the first to popularize it." They also claimed that Google's PageRank algorithm was inspired by their research... Gradually, I realized that death matching type of "algorithms" didn't have much significance and wasn't something I truly enjoyed. At the same time, I also had doubts about the importance of problems like "P vs NP" (Cornell is the birthplace of "P vs NP" problem). Later, I turned to programming languages (PL). In fact, I have always had a curiosity and doubt about programming languages, so why not make it my research direction?

Once I found the direction, I suddenly had motivation. Once I had motivation, it seemed there was no difficult task. Although my thinking was initially slow, I found that I could eventually understand and grasp new concepts.

I might not understand what was going on after several hours of reading at the table, but I could still think about it while eating, taking a walk, or even while shopping for groceries. It wasn't a forced, intense thinking, but rather a leisurely, relaxed thinking... My mind's work is not limited by time and place, so even though my mind seemed slow, I had a lot of time to think.

Oh, I almost forgot to tell you who inspired meâ€”Feynman. Coincidentally, a friend mentioned Feynman's autobiography "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" (Chinese name: Don't Be Fooled, Mr. Feynman) to me during that period. I couldn't find that book at the library, but I did find another one of his autobiographies "What Do You Care What Other People Think." It was this book that told me that there are many people who pretend to be very smart in the world. In fact, everyone is intelligent; they have just been fooled by those who call themselves "geniuses."

Feynman told a story about his girlfriend being misdiagnosed by a doctor. The doctor said she had a certain fatal disease and wouldn't live more than a year. However, Feynman researched her medical records and found that it was not that disease but another one. Although it was also a fatal disease, she could live for at least five years. Feynman decisively married her, bought a quiet house for them, and spent several years with her until she passed away. This story tells us not to trust authorities too much, even if they are experts in fields outside of yours, they can still be wrong. You can obtain a great deal of correct knowledge by relying on your own power. Feynman's book has many other examples where he manipulated various self-proclaimed experts.

This book opened the path for me to free myself from the worship of authority, regained my confidence, and regained my own thinking. I no longer believe in intelligence as something that can be measured by a number. I actually doubt the intelligence of those who proposed the concept of "intelligence," what qualifications do they have to judge others' intelligence? Human abilities are diverse. To judge another person's ability based on a single number seems to only satisfy the unrealistic fantasies of some people.

### Thinking speed is irrelevant

A common misconception among many people is equating "smart" with "thinking quickly." If they find a problem seems complicated, they first experience fear. If they find that they haven't understood it after looking for a long time, they feel that their mind is "too slow," and then begin to doubt their intelligence. The more they doubt, the more agitated they become, with no heart for thinking. No heart for thinking, of course, means no results.

Therefore, one key point in freeing oneself from the obsession with intelligence is not to blindly pursue "thinking fast." In the world, there are many legends praising the quick wit of recognized geniuses. For instance, there's a story about Robert Noyce. A young man asked Robert Noyce a math problem:

Two trains are 200 kilometers apart, each traveling at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour in opposite directions. A fly starts from one of the trains' fronts and flies at a speed of 75 kilometers per hour between the trains. How far does the fly travel before the two trains collide?

Robert Noyce pondered for a few seconds and answered, "It should be 150 kilometers." The young man was astonished and flattered Robert Noyce, "You're amazing. Regular mathematicians always overlook simple methods and opt for complex methods using infinite series sums." Robert Noyce replied, "I used the method of infinite series sums, indeed."

Many people like to use this story to illustrate Robert Noyce's quick wit, and many believe it because they were impressed. I was also initially taken in. After being inspired by Feynman, I started to doubt the story again when I encountered it. Is there any evidence that this event actually occurred? It could be entirely fabricated by Robert Noyce's admirers to show off his intelligence.

True geniuses don't care about how fast their minds work; they only need to think for a while and consult various resources to solve problems. This is the same logic as true genius programmers not boasting about their typing speed. Typing fast is meaningless if you produce a lot of garbage. I don't believe that Fan Nuanman would think highly of himself after listening to this story. Such a trivial issue, such low standards, isn't this an insult to the reputation of every master?

I can think clearly about many things, but my mind is really not quick. People who have discussed problems with me, my colleagues, all know about my tendency. I not only think slowly, but my comprehension speed is also slow, and I often need them to explain for a while longer and draw diagrams to help me understand.

Once they have explained it to me, I will understand it deeply, and I can even help them understand it themselves. I have cultivated the habit of digging to the root, and I will continue to ask questions about any problem until I can explain it intuitively and see it clearly.

I find that in the workplace, those who often lead us astray and go in the wrong direction are the ones who like to boast about their "quick thinking." They speak quickly and loudly, making it difficult for them to delve deeply into thought or listen to what others are saying.

Many thoughts can come from discussions with people, but those who like to show off their intelligence and are very clever are not open to others' thoughts. They treat every discussion as an opportunity to show off their intelligence and make it a contest of quick answers. So they become "single-core processors," even though their clock speed is fast, they still cannot match the "multi-core processors" with much lower clock speeds. Those without confidence in their own minds should first dispense with the worship of speed. Do not just pursue quickness, but pursue depth.
