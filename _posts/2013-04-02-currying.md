title: "Limitation of Currying"
---


Many programming languages based on lambda calculus, such as ML and Haskell, are accustomed to using a technique called currying to represent functions. For instance, if you write a function in Haskell as:

f x y = x + y

You can then add 2 to each element of a list:

map (f 2) [1, 2, 3]
[3, 4, 5] It will output [3, 4, 5].

Note that originally f should have had two parameters to compute the result, but here (f 2) only gave f one parameter. This is because Haskell's function definition style is "currying". Currying actually means using a "single parameter" function to simulate a multi-parameter function. For example, the definition of f above in Scheme is equivalent to:

(define f
 (lambda (x)
 (lambda (y)
 (+ x y)))): It says, function f accepts one parameter x and returns another function (nameless). This anonymous function, if it receives another parameter y, will return x + y. So in the above example, (f 2) returns an anonymous function that adds 2 to its parameter. Mapping this to [1, 2, 3], we get [3, 4, 5].

In this example, currying seems to be quite useful, making the program "concise". Without currying, you would have to create another function, written as:

map (y -> f 2 y) [1, 2, 3]

This is why Haskell and ML programmers love currying so much. This approach actually originated from the design of the earliest lambda calculus. Since lambda calculus functions have only one parameter, this method was invented by Haskell Curry, a mathematician and logician, to represent multiple parameter functions.

However, I want to point out today that currying in practical programming is not as good as imagined. Overuse of currying can make the program hard to understand, increase complexity, and potentially cause unexpected errors. I. Without currying's representation (y->f 2 y): Although it is slightly longer than currying's representation (f 2), it has one advantage. You, as a person, can clearly understand the purpose of the expression "y->f 2 y." You will be able to clearly see:

"f originally is a function that requires two parameters. We only gave it the first parameter 2. We want to put each element in the list [1, 2, 3] into f's second parameter y, and put the results returned by f one by one into the return value's list."

Examine the above passage carefully, and then consider whether (f 2) expresses the same meaning: Remember, our focus here is on you, as a person, rather than the computer. Think carefully, without letting your thought pattern influence your judgment.

Did you notice? (f 2) does not fully convey the content expressed by y->f 2 y. Since we are not looking at the definition of f in (f 2), we cannot see that "f requires a certain number of parameters" or what it returns. f might require 2, 3, 4, or 5 parameters.... For example, if it requires 3 parameters, map (f 2) [1, 2, 3] would not return an integer list, but a function list, which looks like this: [(\z->f 2 1 z), (\z->f 2 2 z), (\z->f 2 3 z)]. These three functions still require one parameter each to output a result.

As a result, the information that (f 2) provides that is useful to "people" has become somewhat limited. You cannot reliably know what shape this function takes after receiving one parameter. Of course, you can look up the definition of f and come back, but there is an "intuitive" cost. If you cannot see all this information at once, your brain will need to make an extra turn, and you will miss some important intuitions. These intuitions can help you write better programs. however, the problem with currying is not only about this "cognitive" aspect, sometimes using curry can directly increase code complexity. For instance, if your f is not addition but division:

f x y = x / y

Then, now we need to divide each number in the list [1, 2, 3] by 2. What would you do?

map (f 2) [1, 2, 3] won't work because 2 is the divisor, not the dividend. Those familiar with Haskell know that it can be done as:

map (flip f 2) [1, 2, 3] The function of flip is "to exchange" the positions of two parameters. It can be defined as:

flip f x y = f y x

However, if f has 3 parameters and we need to map the second parameter to a list, what should we do? For instance, if f is defined as:

f x y z = (x - y) / z

You might come up with this code:

flip (\x y z -> (x, y, z)) [x, y, z]

This will swap the positions of x and y in the list. But if we want to map the second parameter directly to the list, we need to use a different approach. One possible solution is to use an auxiliary function:

flip3 f xs ys z = f (ys !! 0) (xs !! 1) z

Then we can define flip3 for our specific function as:

flip3 (\x y z -> (x - y) / z) xs ys = flip3 (\x y z -> (x - y) / z) xs ys

This will apply the function to the second element of xs and the first element of ys, and keep the third parameter z unchanged. I can tell you're clever to understand this code, but if you write it this way, it lacks some "wisdom." Sometimes, a good program isn't about showing how clever you are, but about showing how simple you can be. Now let's take a look at simpler code:

map (\y -> f 1 y 2) [1, 2, 3]

Now compare it to the previous code. Do you still think the previous code is clever? If you pay close attention, you'll find that (flip (f 1) 2) is quite obscure and complex.

From (flip (f 1) 2), you hardly see what you want to do. But \y-> f 1 y 2 clearly shows that you want to fill in the first and third parameters of f with 1 and 2, leaving the second parameter, and then apply the resulting function to the list [1, 2, 3] using map. Look closely, isn't that the case?

English Translation:

map (\y -> f 1 y 2) [1, 2, 3]

Translation of the Chinese text:

You're quite smart to understand this code, but if you write it this way, it lacks some "wisdom." Sometimes, a good program isn't about showing how clever you are, but about showing how simple you can be. Now let's take a look at simpler code:

map (function y -> f 1 y 2) [1, 2, 3]

Now compare it to the previous code. Do you still think the previous code is clever? If you pay close attention, you'll find that (flip (f 1) 2) is quite obscure and complex.

From (flip (f 1) 2), you hardly see what you want to do. But function y -> f 1 y 2 clearly shows that you want to fill in the first and third parameters of f with 1 and 2, leaving the second parameter, and then apply the resulting function to the list [1, 2, 3] using map. Look closely, isn't that the case?: You spent quite a bit of mental energy to write that code using currying, and every time you see it, you still need to invest the same amount of mental energy to understand what you wrote it for. Are you not bored and idle then?

Exercise: If you're not convinced, try expressing the following statement using currying and flip: map ((\y -> f y 1 2)) [1, 2, 3]

Compare the results with the original statement and see which one is simpler.

By now, you might have noticed that the "stupid way" we used for mapping each parameter follows a similar pattern; while the code using currying has significantly different forms for each parameter. Therefore, our "stupid way" is actually the more adaptable strategy in the long run. three parameters, currying revealed its weakness, if more than three parameters, it becomes more complicated. So, many people intentionally adjust the order of parameters for writing currying functions. However, the design of programs always has unexpected changes. Sometimes you need to add a parameter, sometimes you want to reduce one, sometimes you have other uses, causing you to adjust the order of parameters.... The prearranged parameter order may not meet your later needs. Even if it can meet your later needs, your function will be hard to understand due to currying.


This is why I never use currying in my ML and Haskell programs. The ancient and beautiful theory may inspire me intellectually, but it may not bring the ideal effect in engineering practice.
