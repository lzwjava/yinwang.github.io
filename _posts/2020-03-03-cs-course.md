title: "CS Course"
---

I have gained a deep understanding of the current state of computer education in China and the confusion many people have about learning, after consulting and chatting for a while. I feel it's time for "systematic teaching." However, this time, the teaching method will likely be very different from what I originally imagined.

Whenever I need to "systematically" prepare for anything, I suffer from severe procrastination. On one hand, I don't want to be responsible to others, and the meaning of "systematic" is vague to me. With goals like "teaching well this subject," "systematizing" in my mind, it becomes difficult to actually start preparing the course. What should I teach them? Where should I begin? If I don't understand them, they won't understand and blame me. Making slides is tedious, and there's a long list of anxieties.

In the end, after reflection, I found that my most effective work style is not systematic but meticulous preparation, but rather improvisation and expression as I go. People who have attended my consulting services or joined my chat room have learned a lot. They learned from the dialogue, not the traditional classroom. I am not an "infallible teacher," but rather a "source of inspiration." I can even be somewhat confused and unclear in my thinking, and many "new concepts" I haven't fully understood, or I might even be completely wrong.

But through dialogue and questioning, we generated knowledge that has never been in my mind before, and deeply understood its origins. This understanding may surpass that of documents or books. This is the power of dialogue, it makes me think of the "Little Series" books again. Why is "The Little Schemer" in dialogue form, why can it teach me so much more than regular books with such short length? I have always been curious about this phenomenon.

Once I asked Friedman, why is your book always in this dialogue style? What is this called? He laughed and said, "this is little style!" I later found out, this dialogic teaching method has existed for thousands of years, called the "Socratic method."

Socrates acknowledged that he himself did not originally have knowledge, yet he wanted to teach others. This contradiction, he resolved by saying: these knowledges are not being imparted by him to people, but rather people already possess them; they have the seeds in their minds, but they do not yet know it. Socrates acts as a "midwife," helping others give birth to knowledge.

Confucius also used a lot of dialogic teaching. However, Confucius' method is for students to ask questions, and the teacher only answers, like a consultant; whereas Socrates' method is for the teacher to ask questions, and the students answer. The directions are reversed.

Personally, I think Socrates' method is better, because in the Socratic method, the teacher is not the "preacher" or "saint" role, but only a "spark." For certain topics, the teacher may not have knowledge initially, but the teacher is very good at asking questions, and through questioning and dialogue, everyone eventually gains new knowledge. Moreover, students without a foundation often do not know what questions to ask, so the teacher's questions can stimulate students' thinking. I was surprised to find that over two thousand years ago, someone recognized deep teaching principles that went beyond ours, and they were proven effective in my practice. Every meaningful dialogue is a mental SPA, making one's mind and body joyful. Initially, I was a student, now I am a "teacher."

The boundary between "teacher" and "student" is becoming increasingly blurred. Who taught whom? Maybe there wasn't even someone who taught whom? As a "teacher," I often don't have the knowledge, but through dialogic teaching, I generate knowledge.

Friedman's case is similar. He asks some of your questions, and maybe he himself hasn't figured it out yet, but he often asks good questions. In conversation with him, he's not always right, and sometimes he's even confusing. But he guides you towards solving the puzzle, and in the end, he and you figure it out together.

There are actually several new "Little" books by Friedman on unfamiliar topics: "The Reasoned Schemer," "The Little Prover," "The Little Typer".... However, through discussions with co-authors, learning from experts in the field, and digesting the domain, he distilled the essence and put it into the books.

Given such successful and joyful experiments, I decided not to prepare a "systematic" lecture anymore, but instead to improvise like a jazz musician. The content and method of my teaching may change spontaneously. I. Introduction
