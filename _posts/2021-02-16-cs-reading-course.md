title: "I. Computer Science Reading Class (Experiment)"
---


Yesterday, information about the Computer Science Fundamentals Class (3rd period) was released, and many students have enthusiastically signed up. I ask everyone not to worry too much about applying, I will start reviewing applications after the Spring Festival holiday. Please note that I will not review applications in the order they were received, but rather comprehensively, so please do not feel pressured to apply before the deadline.

Everyone's enthusiastic applications make me feel gratified, as my long-held hope for improving education has received much understanding and support. At the same time, it makes me anxious, as I personally teach and invest a lot of energy into the course, limiting its capacity and potentially causing financial pressure for some young people. Every group class forces me to reject many applicants, leaving many eager learners without help. After experimenting with "group classes" and "one-on-one WeChat teaching," I have found that this teaching method is effective, so I have been thinking of a new teaching method to gradually improve this situation.

This new teaching method is through reading. The content is similar to one-on-one dialogue teaching, but the lectures are not given through real-time dialogue, but rather through staged reading. I will write a book based on my experience accumulated from one-on-one dialogue teaching, which will be officially published in the future. The students in this reading class will be the first batch of "white mice" to test the understanding of this book.

I will divide the book's content into batches, continually improving it, and the students in the reading class will receive the written content in multiple installments for reading. They will then complete the same type of exercises as the regular class and send them to me for one-on-one feedback, just like the regular class. The basic exercises may be assisted by a tutor, while the more difficult exercises will be jointly pointed out by me and the tutor. The tutors will be selected from among students who have previously participated in teaching and have shown excellent performance and enthusiasm. I will alleviate my teaching pressure with this method, and based on my past experience, I expect the results to be quite good. Eventually, I will write a textbook that a large number of people can understand, improving computer education worldwide.

This book is different from others in content, but it also has a unique feature: it is expandable. In the future, I can design advanced exercises based on this framework, possibly charging new fees as "upgrades." This "upgrade" method may reach very high levels, covering the most chaotic and difficult areas in the computer field, even extending to fields outside of computer science. However, since thinking is a system, only students who have completed the basic learning will be able to absorb this content effectively. Upgrades will not be provided to those who have not attended my basic teaching.

Although I have considered designing an app for teaching, apps are not eternal. I recently discovered that someone had made some educational animations I wanted to see using Flash, but because Flash is no longer supported, I cannot access that content. An iPhone app is the latest thing in the past ten years, and the system upgrade may make the app obsolete. If we want to pass on knowledge for three hundred years or more, we cannot consider using apps.

Books (especially printed books) are still the most valuable and reliable wealth for humanity because they enable people to exchange knowledge across time, independent of technology, and even without electricity, and they will never disappear. However, this is only true if the book's author has truly put their heart into it and can effectively convey their ideas through it. I must apologize, but I find that most modern books are just tools for self-promotion. Some don't even explain things clearly, or they just list a bunch of knowledge points. Only textbooks that have undergone genuine teaching experiments can truly be understood by people.

I once started writing a textbook called "Solving Computer Science Puzzles." Although I thought I had captured the essence, I couldn't get genuine teaching feedback at the time, so the content was often incomprehensible to beginners. Through a year of teaching, I discovered the problems and understood why textbooks in many fields are hard to understand. This time, my reading and teaching should result in a genuine computer science textbook that conveys authentic knowledge and benefits future generations. I wrote this book in English first to focus on core content, avoid future translation costs, and for widespread dissemination. Therefore, students in the reading class should have basic English skills. I will use simple English without complex syntax or vocabulary. This will also help improve participants' English skills.

After the official publication of the book, I will translate it into Chinese or other languages. The practice and guidance will still be conducted in Chinese, but some practices may gradually be translated into English as part of the book's content or appendices.

I believe we can start the experiment for this reading class now. Here are the details:

1. The content and format will be similar to a group class, but instead of video lectures, we will learn through reading. One advantage is that learning time is more flexible, allowing students to read at their own pace.

2. During reading, if there are unclear parts, students can ask questions at any time. I will provide real-time guidance during working hours based on the questions, and update the book's content accordingly to prevent future confusion. 3. The scope of content for the reading class, please refer to the content explanation for the group class.

4. Without the burden of real-time video teaching, the fees are lower than the group class. However, since there is still a large amount of guidance for practice required, fees will not be excessively low, tentatively set at 10000 yuan per person.

5. Since there is no scheduled classroom teaching for the reading class, it can be started at any time and can be crossed time zones. Overseas participants can pay the fees using PayPal in US dollars.

6. Due to the need to write content on the fly, there will be about a week's interval between each document. During this time gap, students can read, ask questions, and do practice.

7. To avoid complacency and procrastination, students should complete all learning within three months. During this time, please ensure that you can put in a great deal of effort. This deadline is the same as for one-on-one teaching in the past and should meet the demand. 1. To protect the copyright of reading materials, students in the reading class are required to sign a copyright protection agreement.

2. The content of the reading class is not yet written, so it cannot be provided as a reference for students in the third period group class.

3. I will update the teaching methods based on actual experimental situations.

### Registration Method

Registration applications should still be sent via email to yinwang.advising@icloud.com with the subject line "<Computer Science Reading Class Registration>". The email content should include your basic information, learning motivation, and attach your resume. The reading class will also undergo an interview process. Due to the large amount of individual instruction, students applying should have good qualities, so please be careful with your application. students who have signed up for the third period of the group class can apply to change to the reading class before the class is confirmed. However, once the group class begins, no further changes will be allowed. Therefore, please consider your own needs and circumstances carefully before making a decision.
