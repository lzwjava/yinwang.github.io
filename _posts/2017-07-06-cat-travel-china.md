title: "Bringing a Cat Home from Abroad"
---


After much effort, my cat and I have successfully arrived at my home in Chengdu. I would like to thank all of my friends for their information and guidance. For the first-time pet owner bringing a pet back to the country, there are many confusions and pressures. I have been planning this for at least two months, and any misstep at any stage could lead to problems. The information online is outdated or too lengthy. As pet owners feel relieved after bringing their pets back home, they are also prone to adding "sentimental nonsense" :) In this article, I will try to avoid unnecessary sentimental nonsense and provide straightforward instructions for those in need.

### Finding a USDA-Certified Veterinarian

Directly find a USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) certified veterinarian. This will solve most of your problems. The veterinarian will tell you what to do. You may not need to look at various strategies online or read this article.: You must make sure the veterinarian is USDA certified, as there are many veterinarians in the US who are not USDA certified.

Since everyone's departure point, destination, and other circumstances may differ, no other person's strategy can replace the specific guidance of a local veterinarian. I believe any strategy article is not as reliable as consulting a local veterinarian.

After reading several articles online, I directly took my cat to a USDA certified veterinarian's office, told him I wanted to take my cat to China, and asked for his advice. He provided me with almost all the information, including vaccines, health certificates, various scheduling issues, the latest USDA office locations, and so on.

Therefore, if you are still unclear after reading many articles, it's best to directly consult a local veterinarian. The veterinarian should be clear on how to bring a pet into China. From the USDA website, please see the authorized process for bringing cats and dogs from the US to China:

Below I will only introduce my story about bringing a cat to Chengdu. Since I chose the simplest method, your situation may require further consideration.

### Rabies Vaccine (First consideration)

If more than a year has passed since the last rabies vaccination, get a rabies vaccination from a vet at least one month before traveling, and obtain a rabies vaccination certificate. This is because Chinese customs require the rabies vaccination to be administered within one year, but not within one month. Therefore, a vaccination given within one month or one year may cause issues.1. Notice, the vaccination proof should have the sequence number (serial number) of the rabies vaccine on it. If it's not there, ask them to print it out at that time. Since my vet didn't put the sequence number on the vaccination proof, it caused me a lot of trouble when I went to get it stamped at USDA, and there might be issues at the Chinese customs.

2. This is an issue you should consider early on. My vaccination was given two months ago, and it's fine if you book it three or four months in advance, but it cannot be more than one year, or it will expire.

3. Choose a flight and buy a ticket. You need to choose a flight and set a departure date, then buy a ticket. The health certificates have a narrow time limit (10 days), and you may need to make appointments in advance. It's recommended to book the ticket a month in advance.

4. Try to choose a direct flight of American airlines (UA, Delta, ...) to return to the US. Only American airlines' flights can bring pets into the cabin. If you need to transfer within the country, the domestic flight will definitely not allow you to bring pets into the cabin, so you need to consider shipping. In general, I chose a flight that directly reaches Chengdu to make things easier for myself, so I took a United Airlines plane (UA9) ðŸ˜‚ If you are taking a Chinese company's flight or one that requires a transfer, I can't help you here, you can refer to other people's strategies.

Since the number of pets that can be brought on a single aircraft is limited (it seems like 4?), if all the pets were to join forces, they might hijack the plane :P Before buying a ticket, call the airline to confirm if the pet can be brought on the plane that day. It's generally possible, as not many people bring pets on the same flight. After buying your own ticket, call the airline to request an In-cabin Pet, which costs $125.

Since pets require space for their feet under the seat in front, I bought United Airlines' Economy Plus, as the distance between seats in this class is larger and more comfortable.

### International Health Certificate

Ten days before traveling with a cat, go to a USDA-accredited veterinarian for a health check and obtain an "International Health Certificate." Since the veterinarian may be busy, it's best to make an appointment as soon as you have booked your ticket.1. Be careful, there's a confusing part here: USDA will tell you that health certificates are effective for 30 days, but airlines may tell you it's only 10 days. To be safe, take the minimum value, which is 10 days. Otherwise, the airline might not let you board the plane. So make sure it's within 10 days.

!!!!! Warning about United Airlines ticket counter staff's service level !!!!!

Some people have said that no one checks these health certificates when flying with pets in the US, only Chinese customs do. However, my personal experience was that a United Airlines ticket counter woman almost fainted when I told her I was taking a cat to China, because she had never done this before and didn't know what to do! United, how do you train your ticket counter staff?

She looked terrified, and a colleague next to her pulled out a phonebook to call someone for help. Later, she ran to another counter to find someone to help, and it took her over half an hour to fill out the form. I passed through security and received a call from the boarding gate urging me to come, but I finally boarded the plane last. I had several consecutive flights that were on time, so this caused a delay of over 20 minutes before takeoff ðŸ˜‚

The health certificate must have information about the rabies vaccine, including the type and lot number. I got mine from the same vet, so he filled it in directly. If your vaccine is from another vet, bring the vaccine certificate. To make it simple and reliable, I recommend finding the same vet to handle these matters, and don't forget to ask if they are USDA certified, as many vets are not USDA certified! The health certification format must be from the USDA website for China:

https://www.aphis.usda.gov/pet-travel/health-certificates/non-eu/china-cat.pdf

Note: USDA no longer accepts the APHIS 7001 international health certificate from old methods. However, it's best for the vet to also issue Aphis 7001. Both documents should be provided. My vet mentioned that the airlines might look at Aphis 7001. Due to United Airlines' confusion, I couldn't figure out which file they were looking at (dizzy). In any case, I gave them both certificates, and it took half an hour to get the boarding pass!

So I'm sorry, I cannot provide more specific information. Please ask your vet to prepare both. USDA-certified vets usually know how to handle this, so you can consult them. If you have more accurate information, please let me know.

Lastly, I'll shame United Airlines :P I got the veterinary health certificate, but USDA requires you to bring it to their office to get it stamped. The stamping fee is $38, and you must also bring the rabies vaccination certificate. USDA needs to verify that the vaccination information on the health certificate matches your rabies vaccination, including the sequence number.

However, my vet seems to have had some issues with their business, and they didn't print the sequence number of the rabies vaccination on the certificate. This caused trouble at USDA. They said the certificate was not valid and needed a vaccine sequence number that matched the one on the health certificate, as the Chinese customs apparently require it. I repeatedly explained that it was the vet's certificate I had, and I had no other documents, and she finally agreed to call the vet to confirm. After much hassle on the phone, she made the vet send the file with the sequence number information via email, and then she stamped my certificate.

Bay Area friends, I got the stamp at the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services office at SFO Port. Address:

USDA APHIS Veterinary Services SFO Port This office must be appointed in advance for you to handle these matters, so be sure to prepare ahead. The reservation method is to email to this address:

sfo.port.services@aphis.usda.gov

Tell them your flight time and destination. They will directly give you an appointment time.

For other places, handle it flexibly according to your situation. If it's inconvenient to go directly, USDA also accepts email processing. It seems that you need to mail the materials, add the return mailing envelope and check. You need to refer to other people's strategies or call USDA for clarification.1. This office accepts credit card payments, unlike the past experience which only allowed checks. However, I suggest bringing checks along as well.

### Pet Carrier

Additionally, remember to buy a pet carrier in advance. Since your cat needs to get used to it, you should give him sufficient time to get accustomed to it, so he feels safe. Pet carriers are particular, so I will provide a detailed explanation.

I bought this pet carrier with an extendable side compartment. In fact, its size is quite suitable, and the extendable part was useful on the plane.

This cat carrier has a door on each side. I think the top door is important for air travel. During security checks, you need to carry your cat out with you, not let him pass through the X-ray machine. Since cats are afraid of the outside environment, it might be difficult to pull him out from the small front door. I placed this bag at home with the door open, putting Moh-nai's favorite rug in it. I placed a toy tunnel against the side door, using a rope to coax him through the tunnel into the cat bag. Later, I discovered that he sometimes slept in it at night. Additionally, I practiced carrying him in this bag to the car, driving to a nearby park, walking around, and returning home. Legend has it that this would make him trust the bag more, knowing that he wouldn't be taken to the vet or other scary places.

I thought that after this training, putting Moh-nai in the bag would be smooth sailing, but on the day of departure, it took almost half an hour to get him in! I had never spent that much time getting him into the bag before, it seems he realized what was happening...

Adding to the delay was UA's idiot causing a significant delay, so based on my experience, please add at least an extra hour to your usual international flight preparation time!

I chose a window seat, and as it turned out, this was the best choice. The bag, lying horizontally in front of the seat, blocked approximately 10 centimeters of foot space for the middle seat passenger.

(Please ignore the blue jacket on the right, it doesn't take up space, the cat bag's right side has already pressed against the support armrest of the front seat.)1. Before taking off, I was polite to the person next to me and apologized, informing her that I would hold the bag vertically after takeoff, freeing up space for her feet. After takeoff, I held the bag vertically with my feet on either side, managing to fit comfortably for 14 hours.

### Going through security

How to go through security with a pet? An unusual experience. In the US airport, they seem to be afraid of what you might have hidden in your pet, so you can't just carry him casually through the security checkpoint.

1. Put all other items on the conveyor belt, then carry the cat out of the cat carrier through the pet door, asking airport staff to put the carrier on the conveyor belt. Be sure to use the "safe carry method" with both front paws of the cat facing backward against your chest instead of the "cradle carry method." I'm not sure what the cat might do otherwise :P

2. The cat does not need a harness or leash. Contrary to some websites suggesting you buy a TSA-approved harness without metal, airport staff do not require cats to wear harnesses and leashes. This is not in the best interest of the cat, is it?: 3. The security personnel will call you to a specific small door instead of the general one.

4. After passing through that door, you will encounter a special security process. The security personnel asked me to hold the cat, raise my left hand, then he drew a "fu" character on my hand with a piece of paper. Next, he asked me to raise my right hand and draw a "fu" character on it. He then put the paper into a machine, waited for a while, and then let me pass.

As I raised one hand, little Mouna suddenly climbed onto my shoulders, making me bend down to put her back on the ground and straighten her up again before raising my right hand. But she climbed onto my shoulders again.... Luckily, she didn't use her claws, or I would have been in trouble. Quite an embarrassing experience ðŸ˜‚

After passing through the security door, please ask the security personnel to put my cat carrier on the ground. She closed the door above for me and opened the one in front. I was worried that the cat wouldn't make it in, but he slipped in easily. This proves that my "training" was effective, and the cat carrier is the only place he can trust at the airport, so he went in smoothly, without any resistance :P

At this point, people at the boarding gate called me on the phone, asking where I was. I said I had just passed through security, and they urged me to hurry, as the plane was about to take off! I quickly gathered my things, grabbed the cat carrier, and dashed towards the boarding gate, panting and boarded the plane. Food, water and tranquilizers.

I have read many strategies suggesting that animals should be fasted and water deprived for 4 hours before flying, some even gave their cats sleeping pills. When I asked my vet about handling the food and water issue, he said: "Oh yes, you should let him eat and drink well first. Because the airline may not allow you to bring food and water on the plane, or you might be able to sneak some cat food on board. But he will probably be very anxious and won't eat or drink anything...."

I said: "I mean.... I have read articles online that suggest fasting and water depriving 4 hours before the flight to prevent them from relieving themselves on the plane...."

The vet said: "That's not something you should be concerned about. You should focus on the animal's health. Your flight is 14 hours long, and a pet might be able to survive without food for that long, but not without water is not good. Besides, he is a cat, and he will try to hold it in on the plane even if he wants to relieve himself."

I also asked about sleeping pills and tranquilizers. The vet advised against giving him any medication, as it was impossible to predict what side effects these drugs might have during a long flight. I finally followed the vet's suggestion and brought some cat food and cat treats on the plane instead of pre-emptively having Mochi spayed or fed beforehand. The flight attendant even gave him some water when he asked for it, and I tucked a bottle cap full of water into his cat carrier. He was so nervous that he only ate a little cat food and probably drank some water as well.

However, throughout the entire flight, Mochi didn't have any accidents. He remained calm and content in his carrier, even drawing compliments from the passengers around us. I would occasionally open the top of his carrier to pet him and keep him calm.

But after about ten hours, Mochi suddenly became restless and agitated, trying to get out and meowing incessantly. I thought he needed to relieve himself, so I asked the flight attendant if I could take him to the restroom. She explained that cats don't like being in small spaces for long periods of time, and that he was likely just bored. She suggested I take him to the restroom, but warned me not to let him out, or I would no longer be able to get him back in! She also mentioned that there had been a cat on this very plane that had escaped from its carrier and ran around the cabin, making it impossible to catch him again. After a few more instances of restlessness, I took him to the restroom. Everything was fine, there was no defecation or urination, he just flipped the water I put in over. I wiped it up with toilet paper, sat back down, held the cat carrier on my lap for a while, he seemed to calm down, and later fell asleep....

Later, he became restless again a few more times.... Four hours later, we finally arrived in Chengdu :)
