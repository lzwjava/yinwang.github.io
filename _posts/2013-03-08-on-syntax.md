title: "on-syntax"
---

I have used and studied many programming languages, and I feel that the one without excessive functions is only Scheme. Therefore, I believe it is the best starting point and advanced tool for learning programming. Of course, Scheme also has some issues and lacks certain features I desire, but these are insignificant. After using many other languages, I truly find Scheme (Lisp) to be a very beautiful language.

To fully elucidate Scheme's advantages and compare it with other languages, it would take a book. In this article, I will only discuss one simple yet largely overlooked aspect: syntax.

Other Lisp "dialects" also have syntax similar to Scheme (based on "S-expressions"), so the "advantages of Scheme" I mention here can also apply to other Lisp dialects. From now on, "Scheme" and "Lisp" will essentially have the same meaning.

I believe the syntax design of Scheme (Lisp) based on "S-expressions" (S-expressions) is the most perfect design in the world. I wish it could be simpler, but I have not found a second language that matches its beauty in the existing ones. Perhaps after reading this article, you will find the rationality of this syntax design to be close to the theoretical maximum.: Why do I like this "entirely bracketed, prefix expression" language of mine? This is due to considerations of the fundamental nature of the language. In fact, I believe syntax should not exist at all. Even if it does, it should be extremely simple. Because syntax is actually just a kind of encoding of the "abstract syntax tree" (AST) of the language's fundamental structure. A good encoding should be extremely simple, unambiguous, and easy to decode. In programming languages, this "decoding" process is called "parsing" (parse).

Why do we need syntax then? Due to the limitations of existing tools (operating systems, text editors), most program languages' programs have been stored as strings in files up until now. In order for strings to represent "tree" structures, people gave programming languages this "syntax" thing. However, people like to show off, and after having a basic syntax, they started making things complicated.

Lisp (the predecessor of Scheme) is the second oldest programming language in the world. The oldest is Fortran. Early Fortran programs were written on punch cards, so it actually had hardly any syntax at all.

It's clear that writing programs in this way is painful. But it has an advantage over many modern languages: it is unambiguous, with no complex parsing process.

When Lisp was born, its designers couldn't come up with a good syntax right away, so they decided to just surround the entire syntax tree structure with brackets, making sure none were missing, and they would change it later if they came up with something better. I'll ponder for a moment, if I want to represent a "tree," what would be the simplest encoding method? The answer is to enclose every node's "data" and "subnodes" with parentheses. The designers of Lisp thought the same way. They named this way of expressing things using only parentheses, "S-expressions" (S stands for "symbolic"). This design seems quite "rough," not even worth calling a "design." Surprisingly, after using it for a while, they fell in love with it and no longer wanted to design more complex syntax. Thus, S-expressions have been carried on to this day.

After using Scheme, Haskell, ML, and common Java, C, C++, Python, Perl, and so on, I was surprised to find that Scheme's syntax is not only the simplest but also the most beautiful. This is not just my lover's eyes, but based on certain theoretical foundations.

First, enclose all structures in parentheses, making it easy to avoid ambiguities that may occur in other languages. Programmers no longer need to remember any "operator precedence."

Second, place all "operators" at the front of expressions, making basic arithmetic operations and function calls perfectly unified in syntax, and allowing programmers to use almost any symbol as a function name.

In other languages, function calls look like this: f(1), and arithmetic operations look like this: 1+2. In Lisp, function calls look like this: (f 1), and arithmetic operations look like this: (+ 1 2). Do you notice anything similar? It's the correspondence of f and + in position. In fact, addition is also a function at its core. The benefits of this approach are that it highlights the essence of addition and allows defining "operators" using the same method as defining functions. This is more powerful than C++'s "operator overloading," yet simple. I have an unusual perspective on "prefix expressions" and "infix expressions". I believe that "infix expressions" are actually outdated, a relic from the historical legacy of traditional mathematics. For centuries, people have been using x+y instead of (+ x y) to represent addition. The reason for this is that before computers, mathematical formulas had to be written on paper, and writing x+y is obviously more convenient and simpler than (+ x y). However, infix expressions are prone to ambiguity. For example, if there are multiple operators, such as 1+2*3, which one is it, (+ 1 (* 2 3)) or (* (+ 1 2) 3)? That's why we have "operator precedence" rules. You can see that S-expressions already show their advantage in terms of clarity. You don't need to know the precedence of + and *, you can understand the difference between (+ 1 (* 2 3)) and (* (+ 1 2) 3). The first one performs multiplication before addition, while the second one performs addition before multiplication.

For arithmetic operations, these precedence rules are still relatively simple. But once we have more operators, it becomes confusing. That's why mathematics (and logic) textbooks are hard to understand. In fact, those seemingly complex formulas and symbols are just representing certain "data structures", "objects", and "functions" in programs. Most of the time spent reading mathematical texts is wasted on pondering what these formulas actually represent! This pondering process is what is called "syntax analysis" (parse) in programming languages.

This problem is even more apparent in calculus. Calculus is difficult to learn, and most of the difficulties come from the traditional calculus symbols, which are not well designed. If you want to learn better designs, you can refer to Mathematica's formula design. Try inputting a "one-line" calculus operation (without using its traditional "2D syntax") in Mathematica.

In fact, Lisp can easily represent such formulas. For example, to differentiate x^2, you can represent it as:

(D '(^ x 2) 'x) I saw it? D, a function for handling symbols in calculus, takes an expression and a symbol as input and outputs a new expression.

The same formula looks like this in traditional mathematical notation:

What on earth is this thing? d divided by dx, then multiplied by x squared?

In Lisp, you can actually implement symbolic differentiation calculations quite easily. There's a section in SICP that shows you how to write a symbolic differentiation program. Calculating derivatives, this kind of boring stuff, is what computers are for. In short, this shows that Lisp's syntax surpasses that of traditional mathematics.

I've always thought that if we consider mathematics as a programming language, it might be the worst language in the world. In mathematics, "variables" are rarely clearly defined in terms of scope. That is, they are essentially "global variables." The x in one section and the x in another section often refer to different things. Skilled mathematicians therefore avoid using the same symbol to represent different things. They soon find that they have run out of Latin letters, so they start using Greek letters. Capital letters, small letters, bold letters, italic letters, script letters, ... but in fact, they are just trying to implement C++'s "namespace". Sadly, many programming language designers couldn't get rid of the influence of mathematics, showing blind reverence towards mathematics and logic. Thus, they continued to use infix notation in their new languages. Haskell, ML, Coq, Agda, these so-called "super advanced" language designs, actually fell into this trap. In Coq and Agda, not only can you use infix expressions, but you can also define so-called "mixfix" expressions. This actually complicates simple problems. To make themselves look like "mathematics," mysterious, they are just math failures, self-inflicting suffering.

Moreover, due to Lisp's powerful expressiveness and flexibility, the syntax of languages like C or Pascal cannot meet Lisp's requirements. In Lisp, you can write (+ 10 (if test 1 2)) this kind of code, but if you use C's syntax without parentheses, you will find it hard to effectively embed the condition statement without ambiguity. That's why C needs to use test? 1 : 2 this way to represent what Lisp's if can represent. However, you will still often have to add a pair of parentheses, making the program hard to read, and the final effect is not as good as using Lisp's syntax. In C-like languages, due to their structural limitations, such syntax is still acceptable. However, once Lisp's powerful expressive structures are added, it becomes increasingly difficult to read. JavaScript (node.js) is the best evidence of this.

Finally, from an aesthetic perspective, S-expressions are a beautiful design. All symbols are enclosed in parentheses, forming a "streamline" outline. Moreover, due to the freedom of line breaking, you can easily align related parts. In Haskell, you often find some clumsy, hard-to-read parts. This is because the infix expression's "operators" often cannot be aligned. For example, if you have an expression like this:

case x
Short _ -> 1
VeryLooooooooooooooooooooooooog _ -> 2 To make it look better, many Haskell programmers align the two arrows. The result is as follows:

case x of
Short _ -> 1
VeryLooooooooooooooooooooooooog _ -> 2

As a beginner level photographer, don't you think the first line looks a bit "empty" in the middle?

Now let's see how an S-expression can express this:

(case x
 (Short _) 1
 (VeryLooooooooooooooooooooooooog _) 2) (if (Short x) 1
 (if (VeryLooooooooooooooooooooooooog x) 2))

or

(cond ((Short x) 1)
 (:else (if (VeryLooooooooooooooooooooooooog x) 2)))

In English:

(case x
[Short _] 1
[VeryLooooooooooooooooooooooooog _] 2)

or

(if (Short x) 1
(if (not (Short x) (VeryLooooooooooooooooooooooooog x)) 2))

or

(cond ((Short x) 1)
(t (if (VeryLooooooooooooooooooooooooog x) 2))) lastly we found, this expression "evolved" into Lisp's case expression.

Many other designs of Lisp, such as "garbage collection," were later adopted by many modern languages (like Java). However, people overlooked something very important: Lisp's syntax is actually the best syntax in the world.
