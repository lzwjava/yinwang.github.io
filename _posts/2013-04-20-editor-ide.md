### Unnecessary editor war

Many people enjoy arguing about which editor is the best. The biggest controversy is between Emacs and vi. Vi's supporters argue: "Typing in vi is faster, your fingers never leave the keyboard, not even the direction keys are needed." Emacs supporters usually dismiss this, saying: "Typing faster is useless. Pressing one key in Emacs is equivalent to pressing several keys in vi."

However, there is another group of people. These people say: "As for the war between Emacs and vi, my answer is {jEdit, Geany, TextMate, Sublime...}" These people are tired of Emacs' endless configuration and bugs, and tired of vi's blind pursuit of speed and annoying mode switching, so they choose a simpler solution.

### Temporary solution - IDE

Temporary translation: Editor and editor war. Unnecessary editor war. Many people enjoy arguing about which editor is the best. The biggest controversy is between Emacs and vi. Vi's supporters argue that typing in vi is faster and requires less movement of the hands. Emacs supporters argue that Emacs is more efficient with one key press equating to several in vi. However, there is another group of people who are tired of the endless configuration and bugs in Emacs and the blind pursuit of speed and annoying mode switching in vi, so they choose simpler solutions such as jEdit, Geany, TextMate, or Sublime. Temporary solution - IDE. I have an answer to that. When it comes to programming, I usually choose an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) based on the language, rather than a general text editor. This is because text editors in general don't truly understand programming languages. Many Emacs and vi users believe they can "jump to definition" with tools like etags and ctags, but these tag tools only do simple regular expression matching on the program text. They don't parse the program, so they're just guessing. They might get simple function definitions right, but they struggle with functions with the same name or local variables.

Many people have biases against IDEs because they believe these tools make programming "dumbed down," and that writing programs should be "difficult." So they turn their noses up at free IDEs. Some people write Java with Emacs or vi instead of Eclipse or IntelliJ. But they're wrong. They don't realize that IDEs contain advanced technology that far surpasses that of regular text editors. These IDEs parse the program text and then analyze its structure. Their "jump to definition" features are usually very precise, while text editors are just guessing.

These language-specific operations can greatly increase a programmer's thinking efficiency. They free the programmer's mind from mundane details, allowing them to focus more on the program's semantics and algorithms. This results in more beautiful and reliable code. This is how I feel when I write Java programs with Eclipse instead of Emacs. I feel like I can "see" the program's underlying model instead of just the text and details. I often find that I can see the entire program in my mind at once, rather than just parts of it. My code is usually much shorter than others' for this reason, as the tools I use allow me to perform many more structural transformations on the code in the same amount of time.

For Lisp and Scheme, Emacs can be considered an IDE. Emacs is particularly friendly for elisp, and its Slime mode is quite good for editing Common Lisp. However, Emacs is basically a bystander for any other language. I spend most of my time in Emacs writing short, simple Scheme code, and I have my own simple configuration scheme. Although it's not a full-fledged IDE, Emacs is convenient for editing Scheme. R. Kent Dybvig, who wrote Chez Scheme, even used vi, but I don't think his programming efficiency is higher than mine. My code is often cleaner and more concise than his, partly because I use ParEdit mode to efficiently transform the code's shape.: When writing Java, I usually use Eclipse. Lately, I have been writing a lot of C++, and the best IDE for C++ is obviously Visual Studio. Unfortunately, there isn't a Linux version of VS, so I have been making do with Eclipse instead. However, Eclipse has some issues with "jump to definition" going to unrelated places, and its refactor implementation for C++ is very poor, except for the simplest cases like local variable renaming. The difficulties Eclipse encounters are mainly due to the poor design of the C++ language itself.

### Ultimate Solution - Structured Editor

Designing an IDE that supports all programming languages seems like an impossible task, but it's not as difficult as it seems. There's a thing called a "structured editor" that I believe could be the ultimate solution for programming.

Unlike regular IDEs, this editor allows you to directly edit the abstract syntax tree (AST) structure of the program instead of staying in text. Each interface element's "operation" corresponds to a transformation of the AST rather than an edit of text characters. These AST changes cause corresponding visual changes on the screen, making it seem like the transformed AST has been "pretty printed." These editors can directly save programs as structured data (such as S-expressions, XML, or JSON), and decoding them is as simple as decoding S-expressions, XML, or JSON without needing to parse different programming languages. These editors can easily be extended to any language and provide powerful features that neither Visual Studio nor Eclipse can offer. This would be a revolutionary change for programming tools.

- Someone has already designed such an editor model, and the design is quite good. You can check it out on this webpage, as it includes some powerful features that neither Visual Studio nor Eclipse have, yet it is easier to implement than they are. You can download the editor model from this webpage to try it out. I previously recommended Texmacs, which is actually a "super luxury" structured editor in essence. You may not know that Texmacs not only produces TeX's effect in terms of formatting, but also runs Scheme code.

JetBrains, the maker of IntelliJ IDEA, developed a structured editing system called MPS. It is open-source software and can be downloaded for free.

Additionally, Charles Simonyi, the creator of Microsoft Word, started a company called Intentional Software and also produces similar software.
