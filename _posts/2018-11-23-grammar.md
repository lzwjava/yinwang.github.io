I discovered that many people are still struggling with the dry and tedious nature of grammar. It seems there is no comprehensive grammar textbook available on the market. For me, grammar has long been a non-issue, so I had the idea to write this article to help those who are suffering in their quest to learn it.

This article contains some secrets I have kept to myself for years about learning English. I once considered turning it into a complete grammar book, but later realized that a single article would suffice.

### The Central Role of Sentences

For centuries, people from different lands had never met each other, yet their languages shared a common structure: the sentence. This suggests that the emergence of sentences is a natural law, an inevitable result, rather than a mere coincidence. A sentence is the most fundamental construction in human language. Why is that? Because communication between people ultimately aims at describing an event.

This event might be just one character: eat!

It might be quite long: I had the best liver in the world last night at a restaurant in Shanghai's street.

A sentence expresses an event, or in other words, an "occurrence." Human communication is essentially the narration of various occurrences.

Many people learn English by memorizing words, memorizing many words, but still cannot write a decent sentence. They cannot see the forest for the trees because they have not realized that sentences are the most crucial part. We should understand what a sentence is and how to construct a sentence from the start, rather than memorizing words. Words are trees, sentences are the forest.: You need the ability to form correct sentences quickly and accurately express your own thoughts.

Mastering sentences involves two abilities:

1. The ability to rapidly create correct sentences.
2. The ability to rapidly analyze others' sentences and accurately understand their meanings. two things, one is expressing (sending), the other is understanding (receiving.). Since language is a tool for communication (or called "transmission"), it only includes these two things.

### Essence of a Sentence

Assuming we are primitive people without language. I want to tell my companion "I eat apple" this thing, how should I express it? Without language, then I can first draw a picture:

Drawing is very troublesome, the strokes are too many, and there may be ambiguity. Later, the tribe became smarter, invented "symbols" things, only a few strokes can represent a concept. They gave things simple symbolic names, no longer need to draw pictures. So we have I, apple, these words to represent things. Have eat, to represent actions. So the scene becomes this shape:

Later, we directly wrote out these symbols without drawing frames, this is what we see now as a "sentence". I eat apples.

Notice, although the figure above is missing, this sentence implicitly contains this picture. The person writing this sentence assumes that the reader can reconstruct a picture (or structure) from this string of symbols.

Some people cannot understand others' words, cannot read books, because they cannot reconstruct the structure from symbols. Many grammar books list countless "combination situations," the purpose of which is only to help you reconstruct the structure from this string of symbols. In modern linguistics and computer science, this process is called "parsing" (analysis).

### The verb is the core of the sentence

So, what do you think is the most crucial part of the event "I eat apples"? Is it "I," "apples," or "eat"? I think about it, you might find that the key is in the "eat" action. Because it was an event between me and the apple. This sentence is about the "eat" action, while "I" or "apple" are just components of it.

You can use the word "eat" to express "I eat an apple," "he eats noodles," "cat eats mouse," and many other things. So, smart people extract "eat" as a "template":

This template is called a "verb." The verb "eat" leaves two blanks for you to fill in, with the left thing eating the right.

A eats B. We can choose between A or B in the blank, but no matter what we change, the situation remains "eating." For convenience, we call the two blanks parameters (parameters).

This is similar to the parameter in a mathematical function (the x in f(x)) or a program function. Representing this sentence mathematically or programmatically is as follows:

eat(A, B)

Here, A and B are parameters for the action "eat." I'm just using an example to help you understand, but we don't write English like that. If you don't understand mathematics or programming, you can ignore this analogy.

Verbs determine how many parameters they can have, where they can be located, and what types of components their parameters can be. For instance, "eat" can have two parameters. These parameters can only be some "object." You cannot put another action (like "walk") or an adjective (like "red") in there. The verb's constraints on its parameters are called its "parameter types." In this example, "eat" can take two "nouns" (nouns) as parameters, so the types of both its parameters are nouns.

You may have noticed that "I" in the sentence "I eat apples" is not a noun, but a "pronoun." I will explain. The "nouns" I refer to here include all objects and names for objects. So the things I call "nouns" also include pronouns, such as I, you, he, she, it. If you recall, the English word for pronoun is "pronoun," which reveals its relationship with nouns.

You will find that this broadened concept of "nouns" will greatly facilitate our understanding. In this book, unless otherwise specified, the term "noun" includes pronouns and any structure that can function as a noun (such as relative clauses, gerunds).

A sentence, besides the verb, seems to only have the parameters of the verb left. The verb exerts a decisive influence on its parameters. The verb is the core of the sentence. Understanding what parameters a verb "wants" and what structures can appear in the parameter positions is key to constructing correct sentences.

Using different verbs can produce different sentences. Therefore, to understand grammar, you should focus most of your efforts on various verbs rather than spending several months memorizing nouns and adjectives. I am not saying that nouns and adjectives are not important, only that they are not the core or the framework. I. "Coffee makes me happy." (Coffee makes me feel happy.)

The verb here is "make." It's different from "eat" in that "make" can take three parameters: coffee, me, and happy. Its template can be represented as:

XXXIX. 我喜欢喝茶。 (Wǒ xǐhuān hē chá I told you (something): A (I) informed B (you) about C (something).

For example, Coffee makes me happy. In this case, A is coffee, B is me, and C is happy.

Another example:

I told you everything. (我告诉了你一切)

Here, the verb "told" also has three parameters. Its template is as follows:

A (I) communicated to B (you) the information about C (everything). I mean: A informs B about C.
For example, I told you everything, where A is I, B is you, and C is everything.

Let's take a breather: what is complement?
Now that we've reached this point, I'd like to take a breather. Beginners may not know what "complement" is, and they can skip this section without losing anything.

In traditional grammar, the A makes B C and A tells B C in the previous section are considered different linguistic phenomena, the former being referred to as having "object complements," and the latter having "double objects." However, within our framework, both are simply "verbs taking three parameters." You just need to be familiar with what A makes B C and A tells B C mean. A makes B become C. This component of make is not called "complement" in traditional grammar, but I don't call it that. This component has no special name or position, it is just the third parameter of the verb make.

Some verbs can have three parameters, some verbs can only have two parameters, some verbs only have one parameter... It's that simple, there's no particular reason to explain, because people just speak that way.

People's conventional way of speaking determines that make can have three parameters, determines the relationship between the three: A makes B C. This is like the definition in mathematics, it is meaningless. You just need to practice more, follow this template to make sentences, and you will understand its specific meaning.

The template "A makes B C" precisely determines the sentence patterns that the verb make can generate, defines the relationship between parameters A, B, and C. You don't need to call C a "complement" to understand what this sentence means. In fact, I believe that terms like "complement," "supplementary," etc., are largely meaningless. They originate from a rigid concept that believes a sentence only has subject, verb, and object components, so anything extra must be called "supplementary language." They didn't realize that some verbs can have three parameters, it's that simple.

### How to make correct sentences
[You don't need to call C a "complement" to understand the meaning of this sentence. In fact, I believe that terms like "complement," "supplementary," etc., are largely meaningless. They originate from a rigid concept that believes a sentence only has subject, verb, and object components, so anything extra must be called "supplementary language." However, some verbs can have three parameters, as is the case with "make."] I've mentioned before, for a person's language ability, the ability to "construct a sentence" takes up half. Many people don't know how complex long sentences are made, so they find it hard to understand others' long sentences.

I'm not saying that pursuing long sentences is always good, quite the opposite. If you can express your meaning with short sentences, it's best not to use long sentences. However, the ability to construct long sentences is quite important. It's like having the ability to manufacture nuclear weapons is important, even though we may never use it.

Of course, constructing long sentences is not as difficult as manufacturing nuclear weapons. In fact, constructing a long sentence is quite easy. First, construct a correct simple sentence. What is the simplest sentence? We know that verbs are the core of a sentence, and some verbs can be a sentence by themselves. So our first sentence is: [

A verb can stand alone as a sentence.

Next, add components to it step by step according to the rules to gradually "generate" a long sentence.

This is like building a house. First, you lay a solid foundation, then build a steel frame, and finally add bricks and tiles on top. You can freely choose the style of windows, the color of tiles, the material of walls, and the shape of bathtubs.... It's getting a bit abstract, so let me give an example.

First, I will construct the simplest sentence. What is the simplest sentence? We already know that verbs are the core of a sentence, and some verbs can stand alone as a sentence. So our first sentence is: A verb can stand alone as a sentence.

Now, let's add components to it step by step according to the rules to gradually "generate" a long sentence.

For example, we can add a subject to the sentence: "The sun rises."

We can also add an object to the sentence: "The sun rises over the horizon."

Furthermore, we can add an adverb to modify the verb: "The sun rises majestically over the horizon."

We can also add a preposition and an object to the sentence: "The sun rises majestically over the horizon, casting a golden glow on the mountains."

Finally, we can add more complex structures to the sentence: "The sun rises majestically over the horizon, casting a golden glow on the majestic mountains, signaling the beginning of a new day."

Therefore, constructing a long sentence is not as difficult as it seems. It's just a matter of following the rules and adding components step by step. I eat apples.

This sentence applies to the scene: Someone asks me, "What kind of fruit do you usually eat?" I answer, "I eat apples." I sometimes eat Fuji apples.

The given Chinese sentence means "It's a bit monotonous, so I added some things. I eat Fuji apples." In English, the sentence "I eat Fuji apples" can be considered as "Fuji is added to apples, making it a specific type of apples (Fuji apples) rather than other apple varieties." To clarify that I don't always eat Fuji apples, the sentence is extended to "Isometimeseat Fuji apples." I sometimes eat fresh Fuji apples from a nearby grocery store.

This "sometimes" modifies "eat" to indicate the frequency of the action.

Similarly, we can extend this:

IsometimeseatfreshFujiapplesfromanearbygrocerystore.

My sentence structure demonstrates how a long sentence is "generated." Start with a short sentence, then add bricks and tiles on top. The correct short sentence, following the rules, becomes a correct long sentence. By staying on the path to correctness, your syntax will always be correct. sure, when extending a sentence, you cannot add things arbitrarily, they must follow certain rules to correctly connect. For instance, you can only put "Fuji" before "apple," not after, and "from" type words are necessary. This is like building a house, you cannot put a door where a window should be, you cannot use incorrect parts, or forget the adhesive. In essence, grammar is telling you how these parts should be shaped to fit together, just like carpentry.

When encountering a long sentence in a text, how should one understand it? Many people become confused when faced with long sentences and don't know what to do. This is because they don't understand that long sentences are derived from short sentences and have a structure. The reason many people fail to understand long sentences is that they always scan words from left to right, one by one. The beginning few words may seem familiar, but after reading a few more words, they become confused.

The method for understanding long sentences is hidden in the methods for constructing long sentences discussed earlier. When constructing a sentence, we first sketch out a framework, then fill in modifying components. When encountering difficulties in understanding, we can use a similar approach. We first analyze the sentence's nucleus, understanding the framework, then put the other components back in, gradually grasping the meaning of the entire sentence.

This analysis of the nucleus is often a "leapfrog" rather than a "sequential" scan of words. I sometimes eat fresh Fuji apples from a local grocery store.

The main clause is the short sentence "I eat apples." You need to skip over the modifying components and analyze the main clause. If you find it difficult to locate the main clause at first, you can eliminate the modifying components one by one until the remaining part is the main clause.

The main clause "I eat apples" is a grammatically correct sentence, and it satisfies all the grammatical rules. So, you understand that it means "I eat apples." Then, you go back and read it again, gradually adding details such as what kind of apples, where they are bought, and when they are eaten.

Omitting or misunderstanding the details may result in a partial misunderstanding, but grasping the main clause ensures that you will not completely misunderstand the meaning of the sentence. Secondly, every complex long sentence contains a very short, grammatically correct sentence within it. The key to understanding long sentences lies in finding this core short sentence.

To identify modifying components and locate the main clause short sentence, it also depends on your understanding of specific syntactic rules.

### Sentence Tree Structure

Previously, our ancient humans drew this diagram:

It represents the following English sentence: Many people find the latter method simpler and more advanced. However, they failed to realize that the essential and key things are contained in the image of primitive people. Once transformed into a string of symbols, the structure becomes invisible, and instead, it requires more brainpower to understand. This simple situation may not illustrate the problem, but you will feel it when the sentence becomes complex.

From the perspective of modern linguistics and natural language processing (NLP), a sentence is not a string of symbols, but a "tree-like" structure. We call this kind of tree a "syntax tree."

For example, "I eat apples" actually represents the following structure:

You can think of this picture as an upside-down tree. If you rotate the screen 180 degrees, you will see a tree. The trunk "eat" sends out two "branches," connecting it to its two parameters: "I" and "apples." For clarity, I use red circles to represent verbs and blue squares to represent nouns. I eat Apples of type Fuji.

Then, we add more details to the sentence:

I prefer to eat Fuji apples when they are ripe.

[I [Prefer [To [Eat [Apples [Of [Type [Fuji]]]]] [When [They [Are [Ripe]]]]]].

This is a simple example of how a sentence can be broken down into its constituent parts and represented as a tree structure, with the verb "eat" at the root and the various modifiers and objects branching out from it. This is the basic idea behind constructing a syntax tree in linguistics and computer science. I sometimes eat Fuji apples.

Fuji is a modification or property of apples, so we connect them on the tree.

For this "modification" component, we use a green box to represent it. They point to the part they modify with gray arrows.

Next, we add a time modification sometimes:

Sometimes I eat Fuji apples.

However, sometimes modifies the frequency of the eat action, so we point it to the eat verb node. I. Sentence
II. Last complex sentence:
III. Subject: I
IV. Verb: sometimes eat
V. Object: Fuji apples
VI. Modifier 1: fresh
VII. Modifier 2: nearby grocery store

### Tree structure:
I. Sentence
II. Subject: I
III. Verb: eat
IV. Object: apples
V. Modifier 1: sometimes
VI. Modifier 2:
VII. Complex modifier:
   A. Fresh
   B. From nearby grocery store. From the expansion process above, you might have discovered the use of a syntax tree in constructing sentences. It assists you in quickly identifying the parts that need to be expanded. If your sentence is just a string of characters, then you would first need to use your eyes to locate the required parts and separate them from the rest.

During comprehension, its utility becomes even more apparent. The tree structure directly connects related parts of sentences, enabling you to clearly see its structure. Which word modifies which part becomes obvious at a glance. Take a look at the most complex sentence above, you can instantly determine its backbone with a single glance:

Compare the syntax tree of the original short sentence. Although the sentence has become longer, its backbone remains unchanged, still being "I eat apples." If you write the sentence in one line, you would need to analyze for a while to determine the backbone.

This is why I introduced the concept of a syntax tree to you, as it simplifies your understanding of sentence structure. It aids in constructing sentences and understanding complex sentences. If you encounter long sentences that are hard to comprehend, you can decompose them using a syntax tree.

### Cultivating authentic language ability

To cultivate authentic language ability, it is essential to focus on both language skills and cultural knowledge. Here are some practical suggestions:

1. **Immerse yourself in the language**: Surround yourself with the language as much as possible. Watch movies, listen to music, read books, and engage in conversations with native speakers. The more exposure you have, the better your understanding and fluency will be.

2. **Practice consistently**: Consistent practice is key to improving your language skills. Set aside time each day for studying and practicing. Focus on building a strong foundation in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.

3. **Engage in authentic materials**: Use authentic materials, such as news articles, academic papers, and novels, to practice reading and listening skills. This will help you become familiar with the language in real-life contexts and improve your overall comprehension.

4. **Learn about the culture**: Understanding the culture of the language you are learning will enrich your language learning experience. Learn about its history, traditions, customs, and values. This will help you appreciate the language and its speakers on a deeper level.

5. **Use language learning resources**: Utilize language learning resources, such as textbooks, online courses, and language learning apps, to supplement your learning. These resources can provide structured lessons, interactive exercises, and opportunities to practice with other learners.

6. **Engage in meaningful communication**: Strive to communicate meaningfully with native speakers or other learners. This will help you build confidence in using the language and improve your speaking and listening skills.

7. **Set achievable goals**: Set achievable goals for your language learning journey. Break down your learning into smaller, manageable tasks. Celebrate your progress and adjust your goals as needed.

8. **Stay motivated**: Stay motivated by setting long-term and short-term goals, and by focusing on the benefits of learning the language. Surround yourself with supportive learners and native speakers, and stay committed to your learning journey.

By following these practical suggestions, you will be well on your way to cultivating authentic language ability and becoming a confident and effective language learner. I only introduced the two abilities required of you in this chapter, but how to cultivate these two abilities? In fact, they complement each other. The ability to construct sentences can help you understand others' sentences, while analyzing the structure of others' sentences can help you gain the ability to construct similar sentences.

So the prescription I give you is as follows:

1. Practice constructing sentences. For every new verb, first look at examples, then use it to construct multiple sentences. This way, you will acquire the flexibility to use it.
2. Analyze sentences. When you encounter a complex sentence that is difficult to understand, copy it down. Decompose it using the "sentence construction method" into the main part and the modifying components. You will soon find that your comprehension ability and sentence construction ability have both improved.

Note that when analyzing sentences, there is no need to worry about what a sentence component is called, such as subject or object, or complement.... This is meaningless. You can understand any English sentence, you can become a good reporter or writer, yet you still don't know what "complement" means. You only need the ability to construct sentences and understand their meaning, without needing to know the terminology.

Furthermore, the analyzed sentences should ideally be from authentic sources, such as good English literature, rather than from Chinese-written grammar books. For instance, you can choose a simple and clear English novel like the first Harry Potter book. Or you can use articles from English magazines like Time. It's interesting to note that in Chinese-written grammar books, sentences are often deliberately made complex to demonstrate various grammar rules, resulting in sentences that native speakers would never use and that can be misleading. Such sentences, even if analyzed correctly, can be detrimental. They can ruin the flow of language and make grammar seem excessively difficult, undermining your confidence. After being influenced, you may write similarly, leaving foreigners bewildered by the awkward sentences.

Finally, someone might ask, isn't this about improving practical English skills, but I need to prepare for standardized tests, can I do that? Yes, and you will be able to answer quickly. TOEFL, IELTS, GRE, and similar tests will not require you to identify the "complement" component in a sentence. In fact, the questions will not contain such terminology. Instead, they will leave a blank space where you should choose the appropriate content to fill in. This means you don't need to know that component is called "complement," you can still answer correctly.

In fact, when doing problems, your mind should not even consider terms like "complement." With genuine English proficiency, you will instinctively choose the correct answer when doing grammar multiple-choice questions, without being able to explain which aspect of ability the question is testing. Is it tense? Or some sentence component? I don't know, because it's irrelevant. I just feel that other answers don't "roll off the tongue," and I would never write such sentences, while the correct option looks "smooth" to me.

Therefore, whether it's for practical communication or taking tests, fixating on language terminology serves no purpose. If you ask every British person or American how they answer grammar problems, you will get the same answer. You should strive to acquire this native-level ability, rather than memorizing terminology for academic debates. If you find this article inspiring, please click here to pay.
