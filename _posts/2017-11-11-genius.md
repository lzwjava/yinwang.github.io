title: "Genius"
---

1. Genius does not exist.

A few years ago, I wrote an article titled "How to Become a Genius." At that time, I jokingly told people how to become a genius and called myself a "genius." Today is Double 11, and I want to give everyone a gift. I want to tell everyone a secret: I lied. In fact, there is no such thing as a genius in the world. The concept of a genius is not defined at all.

I wrote that article just to talk about how to become a qualified scientist, how to solve problems better. Those so-called "methods to become a genius" have nothing to do with being a genius. As for me? I never believed I was a genius, I just realized the "non-existence of genius" earlier than others. I once wanted to be a genius, but I found that the word "genius" is meaningless, just a tool to deceive people, so I moved on to other things :p

Some people may argue, "What about Einstein, Feynman, Turing, or Church (Alonzo Church)... aren't they geniuses?" I ask you, have you met Einstein, Feynman, Turing, and Church? No? Then how do you know they are geniuses? Think about it, all the information in your head about them is from where?

The answer is, it's all from other people! From teachers, from experts in their fields, from media, the internet, books (biographies)... In short, you haven't had a personal conversation with them. Even if you had met them in person, how would you know they were geniuses? By what standard did you judge? I. So, calling someone a genius is just hearsay. People love to praise some individuals, turning them into "geniuses." The legend grows and spreads, and eventually, some people truly believe they are geniuses. The most enthusiastic praisers are biographers.

In the article "Godel, Escher, Bach," I pointed out the partiality, the exaggeration, and the distortion of the "Godel Biography" author. The same goes for most "genius biographies."

II. Why do biographers boast about others? Because they live off it. They often don't understand the theories themselves, their depth of understanding being similar to that of a poacher. What qualifications do they have to judge whether someone is a genius or not? Of course, if you blow someone up into a genius, many people will buy your book! Everyone is in awe of this genius, wanting to know why he is so brilliant, so they buy the book.

III. There is another type of person who praises others as geniuses: their companions - classmates, colleagues, alumni, etc. When I was at IU, every time I brought up some insignificant idea, there was always someone trying to prop me up, encouraging me to publish things of little value, making me feel like a genius, leaving me embarrassed. I later realized that these people did not genuinely admire me but had their own purposes.

IV. If you praise a companion as a genius, aren't you then a genius's companion? When everyone recognizes him as a genius, you become his classmate, his colleague, or his alumnus. You can casually mention, "Back then, I sat next to him at his desk," or "His office was right above mine." ;-) But of course, the person you praise should be stronger than you, or why not praise yourself? However, their intelligence is not necessarily a given.1. Turing's genius title was mostly created by his colleagues or successors through politics. Researchers in the field of computation theory were essentially Turing's "users," Turing was their tool. The simple principle behind it was made unnecessarily complex by the Turing machine. They were more than willing to tell you that Turing was a genius, and the Turing machine was an unprecedented invention, without Turing there would be no computer science! However, in reality, no early general-purpose computer accepted Turing's inspiration (Enigma machine was not a general-purpose computer).

You have been fooled by the Turing machine all along until one day you heard about a man named Neil Jones. He explained and proved the same theorem using a much simpler model, even stricter theorems, with a rigorous proof method... Is Neil Jones a genius? Compared to Turing, he was more like a responsible scientist, but he was certainly not a genius.

Not only was the title of a genius used in this way, many industry "geniuses" were also blown up in this way, such as the well-known "geniuses" in Google. I have seen some people very fond of saying such things: "When I was at Google, Jeff Dean was in the office above mine..." :p

The title of a genius also has another use, which is to psychologically undermine your opponents, making them anxious. During my college days, there was a classmate who knew I was smart but knew I couldn't surpass him. Later, I found that he loved to whisper in my ear: "Look at what person X did, they were much smarter than you in high school, they were a child prodigy in programming! You're just starting now..." Do you understand? Someone who cannot defeat you in ability will use psychological warfare, similar to the tactics of a bully. He calls someone a genius to arouse your envy or psychological imbalance, leading you to make mistakes or collapse, thus defeating you.

Is being very smart a genius? What is a genius? In fact, the word "genius" is meaningless. How is a genius produced? Why is it produced? When you wake up one day and come to your senses, you will find that all of this is politics! There will always be someone who uses the title of a genius to achieve their own unknown goals, or to bask in the limelight, or to suppress or exploit others with the "genius" label. I'll provide only the English translation:

This is why you enjoy arguing intelligence with people, they are actually quite foolish. They don't realize that comparing their intelligence or abilities with others puts them in the manipulative grasp of those people, making them vulnerable to being used or enslaved. They may call you a "genius" on paper, but in reality, you're just a tool or a slave.

I'm not saying people can't be used, or that being used temporarily is a bad way to survive. I'm just telling you about what's happening to many so-called "geniuses" in history and in your midst. I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with this compared to other absurdities in human society. I'm not telling you to do anything or change anything. I just think this information is beneficial to know.

Of course, I don't deny that figures like Einstein, Fermi, and da Vinci were intelligent. I respect them, but were they geniuses?... At this point, does the concept of a "genius" even matter? There isn't a genius in the world to begin with. Anyone who brings up the term "genius" to praise and idolize you has either political motives or is still in the dark.

So, not only does genius come from diligence, but also from politics. The term "genius" shouldn't continue to occupy an important position in people's minds. There are more important things in the world than genius. By removing "genius" from your consciousness, your spirit will be freed. This might be my last time mentioning "genius" to everyone.
