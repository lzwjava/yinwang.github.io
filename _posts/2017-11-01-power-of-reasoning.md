title: "Rational Power"
---


A person who seemed to have a high status once wrote me a letter to discuss my blog and some of his views on engineering. I recalled some past experiences these past few days and wanted to share this story. I won't mention who this person is, he's just one of many with similar thoughts.

He said, "You should wait until you have a position before saying those things, then more people will listen to you." I gave him a polite but honest reply. I told him, "I don't need to reach so-called 'position' to speak. The value of my words lies within them, not dependent on anyone's position or reputation. In fact, many people listen to what I say because they understand the content."

This response touched upon some social phenomena and misconceptions. Nowadays, people judge the validity of an argument based on the speaker's "position." For instance, they might bring up a certain billionaire or CEO and say, "Artificial intelligence will disrupt all jobs." But where's the evidence? There isn't any to support this claim, only their "position" and "wealth" to back it up. In some people's minds, those with money and power are always right, which is sad.

What's different about my words? I not only tell you "what it is," but I also tell you "why it is." Therefore, a person needs no knowledge of who I am for them to believe my words, and I don't need any position. This sentence holds its own power, this is the power of reason. Just like a mathematical theorem and its proof, I don't need to tell you who formulated this theorem or genius, I only need to tell you what the theorem states and then systematically prove it. I understand why that person who wrote to me couldn't grasp why I write blogs, why I can share things with people, why so many people read these articles, and even pay for them. I can do all this using a pseudonym with the same effect. I don't need to achieve any other goals, don't need any stunning "achievements," don't need to sit in the upper echelons of corporations.

These words have their own place, they don't belong to me, they don't depend on me, they are a kind of achievement in themselves. If someone wants to use my words to persuade another person, they don't need to say "Wang Xiang said..." They just need to tell them what and why, just like reciting a theorem. That's why Wang Xiang toppled many people's notions of authority, yet he himself didn't become a new authority. He spoke of much valuable content, but was often scorned by some new Python learners. This is called "acting superior to others."

If we follow that person's logic, if I wait until I have "position" to speak, by the time I do, I probably won't be able to speak out these valuable words anymore. To get into a corporation's upper echelons, with deceit and scheming, and still keep a heart that can speak out these words, is almost impossible. Even if it survives and is in its own position, it will inevitably become pompous. So "wait until you have position to speak," this notion is actually trying to muzzle me, burying these information, and keeping facts unknown.

I fully understand the value of these thoughts, so I won't heed such rhetoric and stop my expression. Reason will shine brightly.
