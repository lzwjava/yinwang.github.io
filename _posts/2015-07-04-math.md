title: "Mathematics and Programming"
---


Many people have asked me this question: What level of mathematics do I need to reach in order to become a good programmer? Eighteen years ago, when I became a freshman in the computer science department of a university, I also struggled with the same question. I felt inferior to students of mathematics and the sciences. People often said that the specialized knowledge of these fields was more precious and more difficult, and that graduates of these fields would be at a higher level than computer science graduates if they did programming work. It wasn't until I delved deeply into programming languages that I found an answer and relief from this question. Since many programming beginners encounter the same dilemma, I want to explain this issue in detail here.

### Mathematics is not the foundation of computer science

Many people blindly believe that computer science is a branch of mathematics, mathematics is the foundation of computer science, and mathematics is a more profound science. They think that if they only learn mathematics, programming issues will no longer exist. However, this is not the case.

The truth is that:

1. Mathematics is a tool used in computer science, but it is not the foundation.
2. Many programming concepts can be understood without extensive mathematical knowledge.
3. A strong foundation in programming fundamentals is more important for becoming a good programmer than a deep understanding of mathematics.
4. Mathematics can be learned as needed while programming, rather than being a prerequisite.
5. The most successful programmers are not necessarily those with the deepest mathematical knowledge, but rather those with a strong understanding of programming principles and problem-solving abilities.

In conclusion, while mathematics can be a useful tool in computer science, it is not the foundation. A strong foundation in programming fundamentals and problem-solving abilities are more important for becoming a good programmer.1. Computer science is not at all like mathematics, it only borrows very basic and very little mathematics which is much easier than advanced mathematics in high school.

2. So-called "higher mathematics" is not necessary for the study of computer science. You can use a computer to do integral calculations, but at that time you are actually doing mathematical work, using the computer as a tool. What you are studying is not computer science. This is like how you can use a computer to design buildings, but architecture is not the foundation of computer science.

3. A computer is a more fundamental tool than mathematics, just like paper and pen. A computer can be used to solve mathematical problems, as well as problems that are not mathematical, such as engineering problems, artistic problems, economic problems, social problems, etc.

4. Computer science is a completely independent field of study. Learning mathematics and physics does not replace the study of computer science. You must specifically study computer science in order to become a good programmer.

5. The language used by mathematicians is actually quite outdated and clumsy in comparison to common programming languages (such as C++, Java). So-called "mathematical elegance" is mostly self-aggrandizement.- 99% of mathematicians cannot write good code.

### Mathematics is exceptionally poor language

This is not an alarming statement. If you delve into the theories of programming languages, you will find that the symbols used by mathematicians are actually a very poor programming language. The theories of mathematics are valuable, but the language used by mathematicians to describe these theories is disordered, inconsistent, lacking in composability, simplicity, and usability. This is why many people get a headache when they see mathematics. This is not because they are not smart enough, but because the design of the mathematical language is problematic. When people learn mathematics, they actually spend only a small part of their time thinking about its essence, and most of their time struggling with its syntax.

Take a very simple example. If you say that cos2θ represents (cos θ)2, then it should be logical that cos-1θ represents 1/(cos θ), right? But it's not! Don't be fooled by the teachings and excuses of math teachers. They always tell you: "You should remember this!" But have you ever thought about why? cos2θ represents (cos θ)2, and cos-1θ, which has the same form, represents arccos θ. One is raising a power, and the other is calling a function, but they are written in the same way. Such language design is confusing, yet it loves to use "conventions" as an excuse.

If you read more mathematical books, you will find that this is just the tip of the iceberg of the mess that mathematics has accumulated over the past few hundred years. Mathematical books are full of various superscripts, subscripts, parentheses on superscripts and subscripts, x, y, z, a, b, c, f, g, h, various twisted Greek letters, Hebrew letters.... fonts, black fonts, script fonts, double-strike fonts,.... different fonts to represent different "types". The meaning of many symbols varies in different sub-fields. Some people finish a mathematics course without understanding what those symbols mean. Up to today, mathematicians' writing is still quite imprecise. One mistake they often make is calling x2 as a "function" (function). In fact, x2 is not a function, it is just an expression. You need to indicate "x is a parameter" and add x2 to make it a function. So the correct function notation actually looks like this: f(x) = x2. Or if you don't want to give it a name, you can use lambda calculus notation: λx.x2.

However, mathematicians are quite fond of conventions. They have established some unwritten rules: whatever is called "x", is a function's parameter, whatever is called "y", might be a function.... So you can represent x2 as λx.x2 without explicitly writing out "λx". Unbeknownst to them, these conventions, although they seem to save you a few characters, have caused a great deal of confusion and trouble. For instance, in Mathematica, you can take the derivative of x2+y with respect to x, and you will get y'(x) + 2x as a result, which is quite strange because it considers y as a function. Even more puzzling is that if you add an a at the end, i.e., take the derivative of x2+y+a, you will get 2x! But where did y'(x) go? Mysteriously....

Compared to that, programming languages are much more precise. In all programming languages, you are required to specify the name of a function's parameter. Things like x2 are not a function (function) but just an expression (expression) in programming languages. Even JavaScript, with all its quirks, follows this rule. For example, you must write:

function
(
[x]
) {
// function body
}

Or if you prefer an arrow function:

(x) => {
// function body
}

But remember, even in programming languages, it's essential to understand the distinction between expressions and functions to avoid confusion.1. x:
2. function return x:
3. *

This is a JavaScript-like code snippet in Chinese characters. The English translation would be:

1. x:
2. function return x:
3. *

This can be interpreted as:

1. Assign the value x to a variable.
2. Define a function named "return" that takes no arguments and returns the value x.
3. Multiply the result of the previous statement by an unknown value represented by the asterisk (*).: The bracketed (x) explicitly declares the variable name to avoid potential confusion. I wasn't the first to point out these issues. In fact, logician Gottlob Frege criticized this practice in his paper "Function and Concept" over a hundred years ago. However, mathematical expression remains as confusing as ever.

Many people find learning calculus difficult, but the real problem isn't with them, it's with Leibniz. Leibniz designed the language (∫, dx, dy, …) to describe calculus, but from a modern language design perspective, it's quite terrible, almost chaotic. I can't blame Leibniz, he was several hundred years ahead of his time and didn't know what we know now. But ancient designs are still not improved upon, instead, they are taught dogmatically to students, which is not progressive.

Mathematical language is not like programming languages, it has a long history and hasn't undergone a systematic, comprehensive, unified design. The appearance of various mathematical symbols is often the result of a mathematician casually drawing some strange symbols on the blackboard and declaring what they represent, and what they represent next, … and then they were set in stone. Many mathematicians only care about their narrow subfields and casually design symbols for their theories without considering whether they conflict with symbols in other subfields. This is why similar symbols can represent completely different meanings in different mathematical subfields. In this sense, mathematical language is similar to Perl (a particularly bad programming language). Perl crammed in all the features that people might need without selection, resulting in a language that is overly complex and even its creator can't understand all its functions.: Mathematical proofs use quite informal language in reality - strange symbols, coupled with vague, easily misunderstood human language. If you know what Curry-Howard Correspondence is, you'll understand that every mathematical proof is just a piece of code. The same theorem can have many different versions of proofs (code). Some are concise and elegant, while others are lengthy and complex, like spaghetti, hard to understand. You often see "undefined variables" in mathematical proofs, and the logic also contains various implicit knowledge, leaps in reasoning, which are very hard to grasp. Many mathematical proofs, from a programming perspective, wouldn't even compile, let alone run.

Mathematicians usually don't care about the elegance of proofs. They believe that as long as they prove a theorem, the simplicity, readability, performance, and data structures of the proof are irrelevant. The more incomprehensible it is to you, the more you feel they are profound and beyond you, the more you feel dumb yourself! This mentality becomes problematic when mathematicians write code. They often overlook the elegance, simplicity, modularity, readability, performance, and data structures of code, believing that code only needs to produce the result. They treat code as if it were a one-time thing, like a proof, leading to code that often fails to meet the strict engineering requirements.

The branch of mathematics that values language design the most is logic. Many people (including many programming language experts) blindly worship logicians, blindly believing that mathematical logic is elegant and beautiful. In the programming language world, mathematical logic has become a disaster. Although it is easy to explain its meaning clearly, they insist on writing it as a pile of strange, confusing logical formulas. Unbeknownst to them, mathematical logic also has significant historical legacy issues and misunderstandings. Researchers in logic often encounter various "undecidable" (undecidable) problems and so-called "paradoxes" (paradoxes), which they have been researching for decades without making much progress. All you need to do is change the language a bit and eliminate unnecessary features, and the problem disappears. But logic scholars love to tell you that it's something that their ancestors came up with a long time ago, how impressive!

Using first-order logic (first-order logic), you can write meaningless statements. Logic teachers will tell you, remember, these are meaningless! They don't realize that if someone can write meaningless things using a language, the problem lies with the language, not the person. First-order logic is said to be able to "express all of mathematics," but in fact, few mathematicians can effectively use it to express valuable knowledge. Later, more enlightened logic scholars began studying what's wrong with these ancient languages and created Model Theory as a theory to validate the reasonableness of these logical languages. They wrote long, verbose works to "verify" these logical languages. In my opinion, all these problems are obvious because most logical languages are not very good or useful things. Investigating why they have problems is a waste of energy. Design a better language for yourself instead.

In my opinion, aside from Gottlob Frege, the founder of modern logic, other logicians are mostly following the script, half-knowledgeable. They love to make simple problems complicated, create new jargon, and make it seem like a mystical elixir or magical potion. If you want to understand the essence of logic, I recommend reading Frege's collected works. After reading it, you might find that the essence of Frege's ideas has already been absorbed into almost all programming languages. I. Programming is an Art

You might have figured out from the above that the programming languages used by ordinary programmers, even one as flawed as C++, are actually much better than the languages used by mathematicians. While mathematical language can produce vague proofs that can be obfuscated in journals or academic conferences, code written in programming language cannot be obfuscated by the computer, which is a strict gatekeeper. The code must be put to the test in reality. If there are problems with your code, they will eventually manifest.

Computer science is not a branch of mathematics; rather, it surpasses mathematics in many ways. Some fundamental mathematical theories can be applied in computer science, but computer science is not a part of mathematics. Mathematics has too many historical baggage in its language, it's like a clay Ganesha trying to cross a river, its own salvation is uncertain, it cannot solve the practical problems encountered in programming.

Programming is indeed an art, as it shares various characteristics of art. Art can utilize the scientific tools provided, but it is not a part of science, and its status is not inferior to science. Like all art, programming can solve problems that science cannot, fulfill new human needs, and open up new worlds. So, dear programmers, do not worry about not understanding much mathematics. Mathematics cannot help you write good programs, but those who can write good programs can better understand mathematics. I recommend that you first learn programming, then mathematics.

If you want to learn more about the shortcomings of mathematical languages and the improvements made by programming languages, I recommend you watch this talk by Gerald Sussman. I. Introduction
