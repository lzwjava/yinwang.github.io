title: "advance and concurrent computing focused workshop"
---


The advanced workshop's content is quite comprehensive and covers a broad range of topics in a short period. Although each topic is taught in-depth and extensively, the entire course takes about two and a half months to complete, making it challenging to repeat. I am considering dividing the advanced workshop content into smaller modules and conducting focused lectures on each module. This would significantly shorten the process, make scheduling more flexible, and reduce mental strain. Focusing on a specific topic will greatly enhance cognitive effectiveness.

Therefore, I plan to conduct some very short "focused workshop" courses (also called lectures), and the first topic could be "implementation of continuation and concurrent computing." This topic will build upon the foundational workshop and cover advanced continuation construction, including CPS, call/cc, shift/reset, and other advanced operations. These topics will deepen understanding of operating system process (thread) scheduling, coroutine (goroutine), node.js, async/await, promise, future, and related systems and concepts.

This topic is estimated to take approximately two weeks, with three sessions to complete. As the content deepens and evolves, additional class time and discussions may be added. The WeChat group after the workshop will provide additional thinking material, aligning with real-world concurrent systems. A focused research group will be formed after the workshop to continue discussing the latest research related to this topic. I hope students attending the course will become experts in this field.

The final schedule has not been determined and will depend on enrollment. Due to the requirement for foundational knowledge and potential hands-on exercises, this workshop is currently only open to students who have attended the foundational workshop or read the course materials. Students who have previously attended the advanced workshop are also welcome to re-enroll to deepen their understanding. Interested students can contact me via WeChat. I. Introduction
