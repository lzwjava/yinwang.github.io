title: "misconceptions of positive thinking"
---


Some people like to advocate for so-called "positive thinking," disregarding the truth. Every time you criticize something, they pull out positive thinking as a magic wand to suppress you, saying, "You're such a negative person. Be positive, focus on the good aspects!"

For instance, someone might say, "You've criticized every boss you've had before. Aren't there any problems of your own in this?" All I can say is, if they were really that bad, what could I do? Having not had the chance to choose, I ended up in several problematic companies in a row. I'm not perfect, but in interpersonal relationships at work, I can honestly say I've gone above and beyond. I don't have a mean bone in my body, I'm easy to get along with, and many colleagues, even the chef and the cleaning lady, know this. However, I'm not someone to be taken advantage of.

Companies like Coverity, Sourcegraph, etc., that mistreat employees, shamelessly exploit them, and have extremely reprehensible behavior - should I sugarcoat it? My psyche doesn't know what contortions it would take to find the good in them. The reprehensible actions of these companies have seriously harmed the physical and mental health of employees, hindered their career development, and in some ways, can be considered criminal behavior. Not reporting these people to the court is already a mercy. There are many shocking details about these companies that I haven't revealed yet, and I reserve the right to expose them further.

However, this is not the topic today. I wanted to talk about so-called "positive thinking." Many people don't realize that blind positive thinking is a serious problem. Positivity and happiness are good things, but they should be results, not goals. If a society deliberately promotes "positivity" and "happiness," broadcasts them, and enforces it through media pressure or violence, making everyone "positive think," there's a problem. During the Cultural Revolution, people's thinking was indeed very positive... anyone who dared to say anything unfavorable was immediately labeled a counter-revolutionary rightist. But today, I find that this "positive thought" trend, reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution, is making a comeback. In fact, it has already spread rampantly in the US, to the point that someone even wrote a book to criticize this "positive thinking":1. When you encounter difficulties, Americans like to say: "Don't worry, everything will get better...." "Focus on the good aspects...." "As long as you try hard, you'll have good results...." "Hardships are temporary, there's bread to be made, Go language will improve...." "Crises will pass, the economy will continue to grow...." "The United States is the greatest country in the world, God bless America...." 2. Look at this book, you'll see how much these statements are deceitful. The whole of America is immersed in people's unrealistic "positive thinking."

"Positive thinking" and America's exploitation system and capitalism are inseparable. America always boasts about being a democratic and free country. Listening to this, many countries with more democracy and freedom than America laughed. A truly democratic and free country has no need to repeatedly proclaim itself as such. In fact, America is a country of severe exploitation and oppression, and American people are not happy. In reality, positive thinking is a tool created by the exploiters to calm the people and make them cheap labor. Some so-called "successful people" always encourage everyone to be progressive, to focus on the good aspects, to consider unemployment as a blessing, to be content with the present, and to struggle step by step. Meanwhile, they themselves manipulate power, take advantage of people's naive positive thinking, swindle, speculate, devalue people's worth, lower wages for employees, make them work overtime, and fire them if they lag behind. They themselves gain without labor, relying on their so-called "leadership abilities."

In America, positive thinking is an industry. The so-called "happy nation" Americans consume three-quarters of the world's antidepressant drugs every year. American production of positive thinking and "success studies" books, DVDs, and other products: "Human Weaknesses," "Soul Soup," "Who Moved My Cheese," "The Secret".... Thousands of self-proclaimed life coaches, career trainers, religious leaders, wise old women, psychotherapists, and snake oil salesmen.... Their business model is to train you how to practice positive thinking, suppress negative emotions. They cannot give you any practical ways to improve your life, but only tell you that you need to think positively about the hardships and social injustices, or that you are not trying hard enough, not good enough. No matter what misfortune or unfair treatment you encounter, you cannot complain or protest, but instead "harbor gratitude," because you are alive, which is God's greatest blessing. That's why America has a holiday called "Thanksgiving," which is celebrated only by the United States and Canada in the world.

America's positive thinking industry has become so developed that it has even given birth to a discipline called "positive psychology." Harvard University even opened a red-hot "positive psychology" course (so-called "happiness course"). I watched some of the course videos for a while, and I found it very strange. The course was almost halfway through, and the teacher was still doing the usual motivational work of the first class. There was no practical method passed on, only trying to convince you why you should study positive psychology.... Teacher, I've been sitting in your classroom for half a semester, and you're still telling me why I should take your class? I later found that this discipline is very similar to multi-level marketing. It cannot make people happy, but it can teach you how to sell the course to others, train you to become a "happiness course salesperson," and then you can train the next generation of salespeople.... In the end, everyone became a salesperson, but the salespeople themselves were not happy, because they had no real product or customers.

Do you know why positive thinking has become so popular in America since George W. Bush became president? Because Bush was born to be a cheerleader, and his previous work was to cheer people on. Bush wanted Americans to be positive, to believe that America is the greatest country in the world, and that Americans are God's favorites! ;-)m my experience at Cornell and Google, I tasted blindly the dangers of excessive positive thinking. At Cornell, there's an odd phenomenon where, when you chat with students, if you want to know something about a professor's scholarship or character, the response is always: "He's great!" "Amazing!" "Very intelligent!" You never hear any negative comments, such as "He lectures like reading from a script," "His research lacks significance," or "His students are exhausted." So at Cornell, you can't get any information from students, everyone has tasted the bitter experience of dealing with certain professors, but they keep these secrets to themselves. They tell you: "Yeah, he's great, his research is amazing...."

This overwhelmingly positive information is not beneficial and can even be harmful. If you only hear positive voices, you cannot make correct decisions. This is like buying something online and only looking at positive reviews, you are likely to buy a faulty product. The correct approach is to look at both positive and negative information. Negative information is especially important as it can tell you about the product's annoying defects and whether it will affect your use. When I buy something online, if I'm attracted to a product, I first look at the one-star reviews, as those who give one star are usually disappointed with the product. Of course, there are some ignorant or insincere people, but most people will tell you why they don't like the product. I'm good at analyzing these reviews, which is why many of the products at home are very useful.

Cornell is a place lacking this beneficial negative feedback. You always hear that every professor is great, everyone is good,.... But when you actually interact with them, you find that the facts are quite different. You keep falling into fire pits, wishing that you had heard some negative information at the beginning. But everyone wears a smiling mask, positive all the way, every negative is considered a wrong psychological attitude. What a terrifying place!

Google's atmosphere is similar to Cornell's. At Google, employees talk about every project or team with a rose-tinted glow, as if everything Google does is beautiful, advanced, and promising. At every weekly TGIF (Tell Googlers It's Friday) meeting, founders announce various good news on the big stage, while bad news is either kept quiet or swept under the rug. Below the Google employees cheer wildly for every small thing, like a cult meeting. In fact, there are many struggling projects inside Google. The seemingly impressive projects have a dead end, a desperate struggle. Project leaders are tight-lipped and fearful that upper management will investigate and kill their projects. Inside the company, they engage in various politics, build dependencies, and this way their projects survive.

This hypocritical positive atmosphere exists in many American companies, where employees are pumped up with positive spirit every week by their leaders. I've talked to colleagues from the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Poland, etc., and they all secretly laugh at Americans, saying they're overly positive, cult-like, and have taken the wrong medicine. Europeans are more pragmatic, they say it as it is, good or bad. Of course, not all American companies have this problem, so I still have hope to find a slightly more realistic company. Blind optimistic thinking, ignoring problems, cannot solve problems. You must see negative facts to be able to avoid difficulties and get good results. Positive thinking and boastful atmosphere are eroding Google and many other American companies. To clearly see the harm of positive thinking, I recommend you read this book called 'The Power of Negative Thinking':
