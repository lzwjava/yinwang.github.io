title: "Wisdom in Learning"
---


Some people love to learn and read every character of a book from beginning to end. After struggling to finish a book, they don't know what they have learned.

Others are smarter, they love to throw out various terms, making others sweat from their heads. However, when faced with real-life problems, you find that they have a lot of knowledge but can't grasp the direction.

As for the oddball, the god of pots, people around him often find that he asks some ridiculous "beginner" questions, making others roll their eyes. He doesn't even know what terms like "scholar's cap" and "jade belt" mean. The god of pots doesn't know anything!

Whenever it's time to make crucial decisions, the god of pots listens quietly to everyone's eloquent speeches. Sometimes he casually says, "It seems like we can do it this way ... That way, it should be fine." You initially don't believe him, argue with him, and say that this way won't meet our grand goals. He then casually says a few things and goes back to his own business. He took his words as background noise, convinced he was right. Several months later, after trying out N solutions and learning various lessons, he found himself following the direction initially suggested by Tao. If you had tried to understand him at the beginning, the project might have been completed in a few days.

At Indiana, Tao used to enjoy watching his classmates shout various slogans and terms, witnessing them straying from the path, repeating mistakes he had made several years ago. Some people didn't even realize they were on a dead-end road for a couple of years, continuing to perform for Tao.

Tao was not selfish, but most people didn't care about his opinion, let alone give him a chance to speak. If someone talked incessantly, Tao would rather not interrupt. If someone was so eager to prove themselves right, wouldn't it be more productive for Tao to share his own failed experiences on the same path?

### Dead Knowledge, Living Knowledge

Many believe "knowledge is power," but they don't realize that dead knowledge and living knowledge are different. Most people learn knowledge from schools, books, and scholarly studies, only to end up with a heap of "dead knowledge." To test if knowledge is dead or not, it's quite simple. If you encounter a problem you've never seen before and can't apply these knowledge to solve it, then it's likely dead.

Dead knowledge may originate from truly brilliant people, but for the average person, it's usually obtained indirectly. From the knowledge creator to you, it's passed through numerous hands. Even if you learn directly from the knowledge's ancestor, the average person still goes through multiple hands. Each hand-off loses information content, adds "noise," and may even be completely misrepresented. By the time it reaches you, the "signal-to-noise ratio" is very low. That's why you've learned something but can't use it when needed.

Tracing the roots back, you'll find that the knowledge's creator went through thousands of errors. It's like Edison inventing the light bulb, going through thousands of failed experiments. The creator records their final success in scholarly literature, and you read it, thinking you've obtained invaluable wealth. However, the most valuable wealth is invisible. The author's experience and lessons from those failures are the real treasure. And no one has ever published their failures.

Without these failure experiences, you lack the so-called "insights," so you're unlikely to develop new knowledge from a single knowledge base. You might read someone's important paper, but you're unlikely to develop groundbreaking ideas from it. Your paper will be inferior to the original author's, and you can only refine and add a small idea. The original author and their students, however, can easily come up with new variations because they know how to navigate those paths and are aware of all the unwritten details. "Failure is the mother of success" is the idea behind this.

Godan knew this principle early on, so he often didn't read books or papers. Or he'd only read the beginning to understand the problem. He enjoyed coming up with solutions to problems himself. He wasn't always successful – in fact, he experienced numerous failures. Sometimes, he achieved results as successful as existing achievements. At other times, he even surpassed them. But he cared about more than just success; the many failures were valuable to him as well. He will then go find experienced people to discuss with, these people might be very capable, having done in-depth research already. They might be beginners, just encountering the same problem. But it's quite remarkable that no matter who he converses with, Jottan (Jottan is a name in this context) usually gets inspired. Even if this person knows nothing, teaching him is the same. By explaining this problem to an ignorant person, he often finds unexpected answers.

Dead knowledge is fragile. Owners of dead knowledge are often at a loss when faced with real-world problems, their minds filled with fear. They are eager to prove their abilities, busy maintaining various terms and dogmas. Because it's not their own thoughts, they can only suppress everyone else with authority: this theory was proposed by some big shot, so it must be able to solve the problem!

People who boast about dead knowledge are full of jargon, dismissive of "beginner questions." Those who understand living knowledge know the value of every beginner, even the seemingly foolish question. The greatest discoveries in the world often come from thinking about very basic questions, like "What is time?" If you think everyone should already know the answer to this question, and only fools would ask such a question, you're missing out on many opportunities to gain living knowledge. This is why Jottan often asks basic questions, because he wants to know what hidden depths lie behind them.

This is Jottan's secret to gaining living knowledge. Living knowledge must be created by oneself and goes through countless failures. Without failure, it's impossible to gain living knowledge.

Since living knowledge contains concepts that Jottan is not familiar with in literature, he usually doesn't bother reading literature. This is why many people find that although Jottan doesn't know the name of a thing, he knows what that thing is—in his own understanding way.: The origin of knowledge is best from one's own mind, but not entirely. Some things are too costly to obtain through experimentation, so one must first acquire existing knowledge.

Some people, when they speak of "learning," always enjoy studying seriously, taking notes, and reading books. Some people like to underline books, filling them with neat lines. They work diligently, but eventually find they have learned nothing.

Why is this so? First, because they lack rationality in choosing the source of their knowledge. Second, because they do not understand how to effectively "extract" knowledge. The first point pertains to the "taste" issue, and the second to the "method" issue.

Many people are unaware that for the same problem, there are many different books, and the depth of authors' insights into the problem varies. If you read a book from cover to cover without referencing others, you may be led astray. The author of the book in your hand may not have fully explored the problem himself. He may have just published earlier and seized the opportunity, making the book a school-designated and widely acclaimed "classic textbook."m In school, I have discovered on numerous occasions that classic textbooks are hard to understand. After putting in effort, I realized that the authors of these textbooks did not fully comprehend certain areas. When writing, they also included unnecessary content, cited numerous references, yet overlooked the most important thoughts and intuition. Reading such books leaves you with a headache.

Therefore, I prefer searching for corresponding content online, often discovering works of unknown authors that are more profound. Of course, the internet is chaotic, so don't get lost in it.

When reading, don't keep thinking from beginning to end. If a topic overwhelms you, it's best to put down the book and look for simpler explanations. These resources can come from the internet, other books, or people around you. Keep multiple such resources, and you can apply the same "breadth-first" search strategy to any topic, increasing the opportunity for in-depth understanding.

People say books are friends to humans, but I find reading to be a dull affair. I don't like technical books. Instead, I prefer learning directly from people. Find someone who knows a little, and chat with them. It doesn't matter how much they know or how deeply, I've found that real people are almost always better. At least, during conversations, they won't make you fall asleep;) And often, they don't give you the answer, but through the conversation, you discover it yourself.

At academic conferences, I read the papers beforehand but can't get through them. With a curious mind, I attend the conference, listen to the presentations but still don't understand. Then I use my ace up my sleeve... After the speaker steps down, I approach them and say: "Hello, I'm having trouble understanding your paper. Could you summarize the key points in three sentences?" Miraculously, the author shares their unpublished insights, patiently teaches me, and even becomes my friend. Of course, for such people, I also share what I know as a token of appreciation.: The importance of English

Regarding learning, I would like to remind everyone of the importance of English. Many people have poor English skills and are afraid to read English materials, limiting themselves to Chinese content. This often results in inaccurate information and being misled or even cheated.

I started to read less Chinese content since my college days. All professional books and technical documents were in English. Now I'm not as averse to Chinese as before, but I still find misleading information when browsing Chinese websites. Most domestic TV dramas are filled with absurd plotlines, influencing people's values negatively.

I'm not pro-Western, but the truth is that, despite significant improvements in Chinese content in recent years, the professional level in many areas is still far below that of English. Much of it is inaccurate or even incorrect. Although I usually speak and write in Chinese, I rarely consume Chinese content. Most of the Chinese content I consume is literature, such as novels.

Chinese information often contains various misconceptions, misleading statements, and unnecessary complications in daily life. Phones emit radiation when left on the bed, chargers explode when used up, being pricked by a fishhook is dangerous, hospital chairs are contaminated and should not be sat on, don't drink "yin yang water," don't eat this or that, all harmful... various misconceptions in fact, thought, and culture, leading many Chinese people into unnecessary hardships.: Children in China learn English from a young age but rarely use it when it matters. I don't oppose consuming Chinese content, but I suggest not to rely solely on Chinese content. Every detail should be referenced with English information and analyzed from multiple perspectives before making decisions. Decisions in life are made this way, and the same applies to learning professional knowledge. For the same knowledge point, it's best to search for its English version when you encounter Chinese, compare various resources to obtain accurate information.
