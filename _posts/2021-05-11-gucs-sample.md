title: "Title: Ground-Up Computer Science"
---


After two months of reading class experiment, I have completed the draft of the first six chapters of my computer science introductory textbook, with the last two chapters still in progress. This book is tentatively named Ground-Up Computer Science, meaning "from the ground up," not requiring any prerequisites.

Polishing this book and publishing it will definitely take more time, so I am releasing the first chapter draft here for everyone's use as introductory learning material. Students preparing for a computer science foundations class can also use this draft to preview the content of the first lesson.

The first chapter, despite being the most fundamental, is the longest chapter in the book, with a significant amount of information. Once the foundations are laid with this chapter's content, subsequent chapters with greater difficulty become shorter.

Since the draft is frequently revised, all diagrams in the text are hand-drawn on an iPad, and the colors may not be well coordinated. The images will be redrawn professionally when the book is officially published. Additionally, the names of the two characters in the dialogues have not been decided, so they are temporarily referred to as A and B. A is the teacher, and B is the student. about copyright.
