title: "what is inspiration"
---


I like to use the word "inspiration." For instance, I often tell people, "You inspired me." However, sometimes the person I'm speaking to doesn't understand my meaning, thinking they've outsmarted me, and thus displaying an arrogant attitude. In reality, when I use the word "inspiration," it carries a deep meaning. The meaning of "inspiration" does not equate to "I don't know more than you" or "you're smarter than me," but rather it's a vague term.

If A is inspired by B, there are several possibilities:

1. B did something intelligent, positively inspiring A
2. B did something foolish, negatively inspiring A.. B did something neutral, yet it coincidentally answered a question A had previously thought about.

This is why "Beautiful Mind's" John Nash solved an important problem after seeing a beautiful woman in a bar and thanked her, leaving everyone baffled.

Richard Feynman also mentioned: "Always keep 12 problems ready in your mind. Every interesting event may provide clues to solve one of them. Over time, people will call you a genius."

This seems to be what Confucius meant by "When three people walk together, there must be a teacher among them."
