A student from my first "Computer Science Youth Class" (13 years old) has completed all the courses in the Computer Science Basics program and even finished advanced exercises that adult students find challenging. The teaching process was easier than teaching adults, and some courses were finished in half the time, while one was skipped as a practice session. This successful case further confirmed the effectiveness of teaching.

Someone said, "If you can't explain it to a 6-year-old, you don't really understand it," but my experiment with another child (6 years old) showed that this statement is not practical. My teaching experiment with a 6-year-old friend revealed that due to their psychological immaturity, they might not be interested in the course content because I didn't design "rabbit" and "tortoise" stories.

However, the 13-year-old student is mature enough to do exercises enthusiastically and firmly grasp doctoral-level knowledge. I remember being the same way at 13, always discussing the universe with my classmates after school. I started to imagine what I would be like if I had a teacher like me at that age. I really wish I had the ability to "time travel."
