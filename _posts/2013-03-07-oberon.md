title: "Oberon Operating System: The Overlooked Jewel"
---


Recommended is an old article I once read: Oberon - The Overlooked Jewel

It talks about an operating system designed by Niklaus Wirth named Oberon. Niklaus Wirth is well-known as the designer of the Pascal language. Most people have never heard of Oberon, let alone associating it with Niklaus Wirth's fame. The author states, "Wirth became famous for Pascal, but in the following years, he became Pascal's victim." This is indeed the case. Wirth never considered Pascal his masterpiece. I believe he would have preferred being known as Oberon.

Oberon differs significantly from Unix, as all data in Oberon is structured. Processes do not exchange data through string communication but instead use data structures directly. An intriguing aspect is that the Oberon operating system was written in a language with the same name (Oberon language). Surprisingly, in that era, all faculty, students, and even office staff at ETH Computer Science used this operating system.

The design of operating systems is truly a work of art from the heavens. I. The Great Wall of China
