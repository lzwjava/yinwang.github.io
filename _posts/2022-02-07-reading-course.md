I. Computer Science Reading Class Admission Notice

The Computer Science Reading Class is a course designed for beginners, aiming to master the essence of computer science in a short period. It is the result of my 20 years of academic and engineering practice in computer science, combined with two years of social teaching experiment. This course integrates the advantages of major computer introductory teaching methods worldwide, eliminating the obstacles that hinder beginners' understanding, enabling students with no prior knowledge to grasp the essential contents within two months, which are usually learned only during doctoral studies. These contents form a solid foundation, making it easier for them to understand other aspects of computer science.

The course employs a special teaching method—reading plus one-on-one coaching. The reading material is my ongoing book "Ground-Up Computer Science" (GUCS), and the coaching is through one-on-one WeChat guidance. Although the course consists of only seven lessons, the actual learning time significantly exceeds that of traditional classroom settings due to timely feedback and suggestions for each exercise. This teaching method eliminates the rigidity of traditional classrooms and offers learners the greatest convenience and flexibility. This allows even busy working professionals to complete their studies. Generally, students can finish the course within two months. For more busy students, the deadline can be extended to four months.

The course format is now stable, and I believe it is suitable for long-term public enrollment.

Target Audience:
[No specific audience mentioned in the text.]- Students from middle school to doctoral level in all majors can learn. Regardless of whether they are humanities or science students, they were able to master these contents due to the successful courses. However, for middle school students, it is hoped that the students themselves have an interest in computer science. If it is just the parents' expectation, it may be difficult for the students to read with sincerity.

- Employed personnel, including IT professionals, IT management staff, and other engineering staff.

- Other types of people interested in computers and want to make it a hobby.

Fee and registration method:

- The fee for employed personnel is 10240/person, and for students without income (middle school, undergraduate, but not including research students and doctoral students) is 8192/person. For those who are economically disadvantaged but have a strong desire to learn, please inquire about special prices in writing. 1. Registration: Send an email to yinwang.advising@icloud.com with the subject "Computer Science Reading Class Registration". In the email, please provide your basic information and attach a resume, along with your WeChat contact information. Include a 200-character personal statement explaining your motivation for studying. Suitable applicants will undergo a brief WeChat voice interview.

2. Trial Class: A trial class fee of 300 RMB applies.

3. Teaching Language and Scope: The course uses JavaScript as the teaching language but does not teach JavaScript itself or any of its unique features. The course's concepts are not dependent on JavaScript's specific attributes and can be applied to any language. The course can be switched to any language at any time. Students start from scratch and learn the fundamental concepts of computer science, eventually creating their programming language and type system.

4. Course Intensity: The course design is a gradual, challenging, yet safe path to a high peak. Students are required to dedicate significant time and effort. In two months, students must commit to at least one hour of practice daily, with some exercises taking several hours to complete. Unlike other computer science education, students will not abandon the course due to a lack of foundational knowledge, will not be misguided, and will not fall into traps. Students must invest considerable time and effort but will not waste their efforts.

5. Course Outline: [To be provided separately] 1st lesson: Functions. Unlike regular courses, this course doesn't start with the "Hello World" program or ask students to do seemingly fun but actually boring small games. I begin with the most fundamental concept: functions. There are only a few key points about functions, but they are the core of everything. Repeating the practice of these few points with an open mind allows the brain to think freely about them and transform them. I have designed appropriate exercises for each concept.

The exercises for this lesson are all small, only requiring one or two lines of code, yet they contain profound principles. The exercises gradually increase in difficulty, surpassing the level of doctoral programs. I have renamed all the terms to prevent students from searching related content online, so their thinking is not influenced by existing information, and they can independently complete these exercises. Each exercise builds upon the previous one, and the later exercises do not require any other prerequisites. Interestingly, with proper guidance, many students have completed the most difficult exercises, even those with no prior knowledge. I won't disclose the specific content for confidentiality reasons.

2nd lesson: Recursion. Recursion is one of the most essential concepts in computer science (or mathematics). I begin with the simplest recursive function to understand its essence and master the systematic thinking about recursion. Recursion is a concept that many people believe they understand, but in reality, they have been misled by incorrect teaching methods. Many people mention recursion and only think of "Hanoi Towers" or "Eight Queens" problems, but they cannot apply it to solve real-world problems. Many programming books superficially emphasize the "drawbacks" of recursion and teach students how to "eliminate recursion," but they don't see the root cause of the problem—early implementations of function calls in certain languages (like C) were incorrect and inefficient, leading students to be taught to avoid recursion. Since they never truly understood recursion's thought process, when they encounter complex recursive functions in their future work, they feel overwhelmed.

3rd lesson: Linked lists. Starting from scratch, students will not depend on any language features to implement the most basic data structures. The first data structure students will implement is a linked list, and they will write many functions to operate on linked lists in their exercises. These functions have been carefully selected and arranged, many of which are basic functions in functional programming languages, but students will learn to write them independently, mastering the recursive systematic thinking. This enables them to think freely about these data structures and solve new recursive problems.

Unlike regular data structure courses, most of the implementations in this course are "functional data structures," which have some unique, useful properties. Since their logical structure is clear, they are easier to understand than traditional data structure books. Unlike the teaching methods of the Haskell community, I do not dogmatically emphasize the benefits of pure functions but objectively let students understand their advantages and discover their weaknesses. Once they have learned these structures, they can easily extend them to non-functional structures, seamlessly combining the two seemingly different styles. fourth lesson: tree. Extending from linked lists, we gradually introduce more complex data structures—trees. Trees are one of the most common and essential data structures in computer science, so understanding tree operations is important. Our trees are all functional.

fifth lesson: calculator. After getting familiar with the basic tree operations, implement a relatively advanced calculator that can calculate any nested arithmetic expressions. Arithmetic expressions are a kind of "expression tree". Students will understand the principle "an expression is a tree" from this exercise.

sixth lesson: hash table. Understand how to implement a key-value lookup structure and implement two important lookup data structures ourselves. Our lookup structures are all functional data structures. These structures will play a big role in the interpreters we will explain later, deepening and solidifying our understanding.

seventh lesson: interpreter. Leveraging the foundation we've built, implement a computer science fundamental and often misunderstood concept—an interpreter. Interpreters are key to understanding various computer science concepts such as programming languages, operating systems, databases, network protocols, and web frameworks. A computer's most fundamental component, the CPU, is essentially an interpreter. Understanding interpreters will help you understand "computer system architecture", the "hardware", and you'll find that hardware and software are not that different. You can think of interpreters as "computation itself", making them worthwhile to study. Deep comprehension of interpreters will also help in understanding various other subjects, such as natural language processing, logic.
