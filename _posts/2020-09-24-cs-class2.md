I. Computer Science Collective Class (Second Session) Enrollment

The computer science fundamental teaching started in April and it has been almost half a year now. Whether it's a collective class or one-on-one teaching, both have achieved satisfactory results. Many people have acquired real knowledge, and I myself have gained a clearer understanding of the content and teaching methods. Through continuous iteration, reflection, and improvement, the teaching steps and methods have been maturing.

Recently, I have had some learning experiences in new fields, and I have deeply felt the problems that have long existed in Chinese education. The reality is that China lacks a deep and comprehensive understanding of knowledge in almost any field. Most things learned from abroad are superficial and shallow. Superficial learning and imitation are rampant. Therefore, it is very difficult to find good teachers in China for almost any field. My interested fields are no exception, and I can only rely on myself to ponder or directly learn from foreign resources.

I cannot bear to see such a large country treat knowledge in this way and continue to lag behind. It's time for change.

One-on-one question and answer teaching is successful, and it has given me some understanding of human cognitive laws. However, due to the large amount of repetition in one-on-one teaching, it becomes monotonous for teachers over time, although each student finds it very novel. It is beneficial for improving teaching methods at the beginning, but teaching the same things to another person the next day is not interesting. Therefore, I decided to limit the number of one-on-one teaching, increase the price, and be more selective in applicants. I will put more effort into group teaching in the near future. Group teaching may not be as flexible as one-on-one instruction, but due to the advanced teaching methods and content arrangements, the results are still significantly better than traditional computer science programs in universities.

I don't want to elaborate on my advanced teaching methods here as I have found that some people steal "keywords" and use them as their own advertising slogans without being able to deliver the substance. My proposed "question-and-answer teaching" method has already produced some "counterfeit products." It seems that even the best ideas end up being copied extensively in China and become hollow slogans. Furthermore, excessive promotion will attract many inappropriate people, so I don't want to promote myself.

I have decided to convene the second period of the computer science foundation class, but I will not disclose many details and characteristics here, only mentioning the key points for registration:

1. Tuition fee adjusted to 6000 yuan per person.
2. Teaching method is Zoom video instruction. 1. The time span is approximately two months (excluding statutory holidays). Classes start after National Day.

2. One class per week, a total of 8 classes. One weekly discussion session is arranged for interaction.

3. Post-class practice remains one-on-one feedback and correction, but experienced teaching assistants may be arranged to help. The teacher will directly guide for areas where teaching assistants are unsure.

4. The content covers fundamental ideas in computer science, serving as a solid foundation for understanding and mastering broader knowledge.

5. Due to time zone issues, it may not be possible to accommodate foreign registrants with significant time differences. 1. The number of people will be relaxed a little. Since group teaching is not common for people to ask questions, it won't be a question-and-answer style, but there may be active students participating in the Q&A, with the goal of inspiring everyone.

2. "Basics" do not mean "easy" or "beginner," the course content may start from scratch but will eventually delve deeply. This is not common knowledge for programmers, so we no longer require applicants to be complete beginners. However, those with a foundation need to understand that this teaching still starts from scratch and requires re-acquainting with the most basic knowledge.

### Person Requirements

Mental health, polite, respect teachers and other students. Humble and eager to learn, able to discuss equally.: Sending email. Subject: Application for Computer Science Fundamentals Course (Second Period). Contents include:

1. Your full name, a brief self-introduction, including education background, workplace, job content, and motivation for attending classes.

2. Your location, for scheduling purposes.

3. Attach resume (in PDF format).

4. Your WeChat number, for contact purposes.1. Due to the large number of applicants, please be patient for a reply. I will arrange for simple phone interviews.

2. Students who have joined one-on-one teaching but have not finished, or those whose time span has not exceeded, can attend group classes for free as a supplement or review. Interested parties can contact me for the Zoom meeting number when the time comes.

3. Discount for Knowledge Circle members

4. I didn't consider the questioning method when I established the Knowledge Circle earlier. I feel that the effect of the Knowledge Circle is not good. A good method should be the teacher asking questions, not the students. Without the teacher's input and guidance, students will have difficulty raising good questions. The number of questions is decreasing and becoming more profound, so the Knowledge Circle no longer accepts new members. Some people's questions entered certain misunderstandings, but because they were eager, I couldn't just dismiss them. Due to the effectiveness of teaching, I have been inactive in the Knowledge Circle for a long time. I. To express gratitude to the members of Zhishisxq, I thank them for their support. Members who apply for the Computer Science Foundation Course will be given a 2000 yuan discount. This is equivalent to refunding the actual income of Zhishisxq (excluding platform service fees). Therefore, Zhishisxq members only need to pay 4000 yuan in tuition fees when they register for the Foundation Course. Please indicate your Zhishisxq username in your application.
