title: "Alpha-Go"
---

: In a previous article, I pointed out that the "visual recognition ability" and "common sense judgment ability" required for autonomous driving are extremely difficult problems for machines. To this day, no machine has reached the level of a donkey in the visual domain, let alone surpassing humans. However, recently Google's AlphaGo defeated the Go world champion, making quite a stir, deepening the misunderstanding about AI.

Initially, it was just a game, but they blew it up as a "historic human-machine battle," making it seem like the machine challenged human intelligence and hurt human pride. This entire project was marketed under a rather grand banner called "DeepMind." Of course, there were some impressive-sounding technologies within it, such as "neural networks" and "deep learning"...

When people hear this, there are always some half-informed individuals who, based on the plot of science fiction movies, start making predictions about the future of humanity based on these powerful technologies. For example, self-driving cars are about to be realized, people's jobs will be taken over by machines in no time, and even Skynet will control humanity, and so on.

I just want to remind these people: please don't daydream about science fiction anymore and come back to reality. Chess-like problems are relatively easy for AI.

A common misconception is that AlphaGo actually possesses "human intelligence," so Google should be able to achieve autonomous vehicles using the same technology. These people not only overestimate the capabilities of so-called "AI," but they also fail to understand that the difficulties of different "AI problems" are actually quite distinct.

Go is simple, the world is complex. Machine vision and autonomous vehicles are much more difficult than Go, orders of magnitude so. To achieve accurate visual judgment abilities, machines must possess genuine cognitive abilities and common sense, which is not what AlphaGo uses in the form of tree search and neural networks to solve. Due to the need to process "simulated signals" at extremely high speeds, this is not a problem that can be solved by the digital computers commonly used by people. In other words, it's not just a matter of writing code.

Artificial intelligence experts have discovered an interesting phenomenon for a long time:

- For humans, things that are difficult and annoying (complex calculations, playing Go, reasoning...), for computers, they are relatively easy.: For humans, easy things (recognizing people, walking, driving a car, playing ball...), but for computers, they are very difficult.

Computers cannot handle complex environments and can only work in relatively perfect environments, requiring precise, discrete inputs.

Humans have high adaptability to environments and are good at handling vague, continuous, imperfect data.

From the above points, you can see that chess activities are perfectly suited to computers, as they are always in a isolated, perfect environment, with discrete, precise, limited inputs. The chessboard has only a few dozen or hundreds of points, not randomly placed. Each person moves one step at a time, taking turns, and cannot act randomly. The information on the entire chessboard is completely visible, with no hidden or missing information. The "search space" of the chess game is very large but regular and orderly. If relying solely on experience and skill, the first move in Go has 361 possibilities, the second move has 360 possibilities, ...

This is a very favorable situation for machines, as they can have a plan and steps, methodically calculating all possible situations and choosing the most advantageous move many steps ahead. Therefore, playing Go fundamentally is a "tree search" problem, but due to the large scale, optimization is required. The search space of Go is very large but is a known quantity, with a maximum of 250,150 possibilities. AlphaGo uses so-called "neural networks" to optimize during the search, excluding unlikely winning situations as early as possible to avoid wasting calculation time. I. Precise and Rigid Activities: Similar to Calculating a Large Multiplication Problem

This precise and rigid activity is similar in nature to calculating a large multiplication problem, like 2463757 x 65389, only on a much larger scale. It's tedious and laborious for humans, but computers are indifferent, as they are merely machines. When "Deep Blue" defeated the international chess world champion, I had already predicted that a computer would eventually become the go champion, so there was no need to play these mind-numbing games anymore. Sadly, many people still regard mastering the art of go as a source of pride, as part of the "four arts of Chinese scholars" (scholarship, calligraphy, painting, and go). Many Chinese people believe that Chinese people always lose to Koreans at go, which is a source of shame. Looking back, how amusing! It's just like being mathematically challenged and feeling ashamed because the Koreans are quicker at mental arithmetic.

II. Cognition is the Real Challenge for AI

Let's compare everyday tasks, such as pouring water into a teacup.

How difficult would it be for a machine to pour water for you? Surprisingly difficult! Consider this scenario. If your computer is equipped with a camera, how would it know where the teapot is? The teapot's material, color, shape, and angle can vary in countless ways. Some teapots are like mirrors, reflecting the shapes of surrounding objects. The tabletop is filled with various reflections and shadows, and different materials have distinct reflective properties, all significantly affecting the machine's recognition of objects.

To recognize objects, the machine must have common sense. Its brain must contain concepts, knowing what constitutes a "teapot" and a "teacup." Don't underestimate the difficulty of this step; it means the machine must understand fundamental "topological structures," what constitutes a "continuous plane," what is a "hole," what is "concave" and "convex," what is "inside" and "outside"... Additionally, this machine must distinguish objects from shadows. It must know what water is, what its fluid properties are, what is "flowing." It must know "water flows downhill," and then it must understand what "down" and "up" mean... It must know why a teacup can hold water, where the handle is, and how to pick up the teapot. If the handle isn't visible, where is it? Which side of the teapot is "up," and how do you pour water from the teapot's spout without spilling from the lid? What is a cracked teacup, why does it leak, what is a chipped teacup, and why does it still hold water? What does a clean teacup look like, what is a dirty teacup, what is tea staining, and why isn't it considered dirty? How do you control the flow rate and droplet size, what is "water splashes out," and how do you pour water without splashing?... you might not have realized, making tea is such a simple thing that requires so much common sense. All these variables add up, in fact, far exceed the number of moves in a game of Go, yet people can complete it effortlessly. This ability, truly, should make one jump in surprise, yet people take it for granted and call it "trivial." Because other people can do these things, even monkeys can, how can it make me look special? People's ego and vanity, once again, have clouded their own judgment. They failed to realize, this is actually a valuable ability, something that machines find difficult to match. They said: "Machines will eventually learn to do it. Look, we have neural networks and deep learning!"

### What is Machine Learning

Some people like to intimidate others with "machine learning" or "deep learning," assuming that the presence of the word "learning" makes it magical. But in fact, machine learning is completely different from human learning. A machine's "learning ability" is not much more than that of a rock, as machine learning, in essence, is just a matter of statistically inferring the parameters of a function from a large amount of data.

For example, you collect some two-dimensional data points. You suspect they follow a simple function y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, but you don't know what a, b, c, and d should be. So you use so-called "machine learning" (i.e., mathematical statistics) to infer the values of a, b, c, and d, making the collected data as close as possible to this function's curve. But where did this function come from? Ultimately, it was thought up by people. Machines can't jump out of the y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d box no matter what. If the data doesn't fit this format, you can only find a function that fits the data properties better by relying on people.

So-called neural networks are actually just another function. In essence, they're no different from y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, as they only have more input parameters and a more complex logic. "Neural networks" have nothing to do with neurons, yet they love to claim inspiration from them. Neural networks are a very clever marketing term, deceiving countless people. Because there are "neurons" in it, many people think it will give machines intelligence, but in reality, this is just a matter of statistical fitting. You can fit out a very good function, but this has nothing to do with intelligence. AlphaGo is not a breakthrough in artificial intelligence history

AlphaGo's victory over the Go champion is similar in significance to IBM's "Deep Blue" computer's victory over the international chess world champion. The ability to write a program that beats a world champion in these games is indeed a progress, it will certainly bring improvements to specific applications. However, it does not signify revolutionary progress in AI, let alone indicate that computers have acquired genuine, general intelligence. Quite the opposite, a computer's ability to beat humans in games like Go actually demonstrates that such activities do not require much intelligence. The ability to play these games is not a reliable measure of human intelligence.

Famous cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter, author of "GEB", had long pointed out that popular topics in AI such as computer Go, are almost completely unrelated to genuine human intelligence. Most people don't really understand what thinking and intelligence are. Most so-called AI experts know very little about how the human brain works, let alone care.

The technology used by AlphaGo may be applicable to other similar games, but it cannot serve as a general solution to real-world problems. Especially, this technology cannot bring a breakthrough to the development of autonomous cars. Autonomous cars must work nearly perfectly to be acceptable, which requires them to have human-level visual recognition ability. For instance, they must be able to detect that a car in front has a loose load about to fall off and quickly change lanes, overtake it. Unfortunately, an autonomous car's "eyes" see only cubic blocks, and it barely understands what is happening around it. It just follows and yields to some lines and blocks.... We wish roads were as simple, clear, and perfect as games, but they are not. Every detail matters in the real world, and it's a matter of life and death.

For those who are passionate about AlphaGo, please stop being infatuated with autonomous cars and Skynet-like fantasies. Recognize the essence of AI and "neural networks", use them for useful purposes, and there's no need to harbor excessive hopes for realizing "human intelligence". I. The Great Wall of China
