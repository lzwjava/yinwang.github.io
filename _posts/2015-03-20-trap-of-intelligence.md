title: "trap-of-intelligence"
---

I bought a Nintendo 3DS game console last time and found the games boring, so I sold both the console and the game to someone else the next day. I started pondering over a question since then - what makes a game enjoyable or unenjoyable for me. I seem to have a peculiar taste for things, many games or movies that others find entertaining or interesting, I find dull or self-harming. Throughout my life, the games I enjoyed the most can be counted on my fingers. They include Braid, Limbo, Klonoa (Wind's Klonoa: Door to Phantomile), Ico, Metal Gear Solid, and so on.

If you think I have a high IQ and that's why I find many games lacking in challenge and unenjoyable, you're wrong. I'm not someone who seeks challenges. I find that many games lack not in challenge and difficulty, but in design. I couldn't finish many games, yet I find them dull, tedious, repetitive, and formulaic. I don't get depressed because I can't finish games, do homework, or understand books. Quite the opposite, I believe my intelligence shouldn't be used for such tasks. If there's something that makes me depressed, I usually think it's the problem with that thing, not me. If I'm wrong, my mistake lies in choosing to participate in such activities, and I shouldn't have done so. That's why I'm usually happier than most people.

People have a strange inclination; they enjoy challenges or showing off their intelligence. Whenever I recommend games like Braid to someone, they assume I like puzzle games, so they recommend games like Zelda or Antichamber to me, telling me they're intellectually stimulating. But I usually can't play these games for more than a few minutes before getting bored. This shows I'm not into puzzle games, but rather into certain other features of games. People who enjoy Zelda, Antichamber, or BioShock-type games often have a masochistic inclination. These people seem to care a lot about their intelligence, so they feel validated when they finish a game. If you tell them these games are too difficult or tedious, they'll look down on your intelligence and boast about how quickly they finished the game.

However, if you take a step back, you'll find that these games all follow certain design formulas. Once you understand these formulas, you can easily create such games yourself. Then you'll realize that people who are passionate about these games aren't particularly intelligent, as they've been manipulated by game designers and haven't discovered the design formulas. These people seek others' approval, validation, or training of their supposed "intelligence," and even conformity, by choosing these "masochistic" games.1. This kind of game, as time goes by, you'll find it's not for entertainment, but for completing tasks. It's not you playing the game, but the game playing you. You hope it ends soon, but you can't quit immediately because you tell yourself: "If I give up halfway, I'm a coward, a fool, no longer a genius...." You roam around in the virtual space, probing and searching for the keys to unlock mechanisms, but they are intentionally placed in frustrating locations by the game's designers. You don't feel happiness, but tedium, despair, and emptiness.

2. I've found that people who easily fall into this trap share a similar tendency in their daily life and work. In general, they are the type described in Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" final speech, "thinking too much, feeling too little." These people, if they continue on this path, will become people who think like machines. It is these people who have brought disaster to the world. Hitler was a typical representative of this type, who was overly concerned with being superior and intelligent, yet felt no compassion or suffering for fellow humans, leading to cruel slaughter of those he deemed inferior.

3. So, I don't really enjoy Braid, Limbo, Klonoa and other games because of their intellectual challenge. I enjoy them because they are filled with creativity and imagination, yet not tedious or cumbersome. In these games, you can do things you never thought possible, and their design can be described as "ineffable." The logic is seamless and fluid, requiring no aimless collisions or aimless running, but rather a smooth, effortless progression, yet still filled with waves, undulations, and clever twists. It's like watching a mesmerizing movie. You don't feel despair, confusion, or a test of intelligence and judgment, but true enjoyment and release.

4. When I recommended Klonoa to a friend, I said, "It feels like you're in a dream...." He replied, "You know there's another game called something that has a four-dimensional space, right...." I wasn't discussing the "nature of dreams" with him, but rather the "dreamlike feeling." This friend was of the type I mentioned earlier, "thinking too much." I said it was like a dream, meaning a feeling that only the heart can perceive; but he interpreted "dream" as a theoretical concept, like the multi-dimensional spaces in mathematics, which require analytical reasoning to understand. Due to excessive rationality, he was always preoccupied with analyzing these "deep-rooted" theories, unable to perceive the joy that I could easily sense. My advice to him was: "Think less, analyze less, feel more." The value of games like Klonoa lies not in intelligence and difficulty, but in the feeling of wonder, creativity, freedom, imagination, and art that they evoke.
