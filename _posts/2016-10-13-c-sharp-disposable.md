title: "IDisposable Interface in C#"
---


I've been driven crazy by disposable objects implementing IDisposable interface in Microsoft's C# team....

The story is quite long, let me first explain. If you're not familiar with C#, IDisposable is an interface designed by Microsoft for "resource management" in C#, similar to Java's Closeable interface. These interfaces usually provide a "method" (like Dispose or Close), and your resource (like a file stream) implements this interface. The user opens the resource first, then calls this method when done, indicating "closing the resource." For instance, opening a file, reading and writing, then calling close to turn it off. Seems simple, right?;-)

Compared to Java, C# is usually a better language, but it doesn't fully surpass Java. A notable deficiency is the headache caused by C#'s IDisposable interface, which is much more than Java's Closeable. After analyzing this aspect, I believe it's due to the implementation of unnecessary IDisposable in .NET library code, making it necessary for you to consider how to handle them often. Additionally, due to Microsoft's coding standards and Roslyn static analysis, users overly care about the "correct usage" of IDisposable, leading to unnecessary complex code and the spread of IDisposable in user code.

### IDisposable issues I'd be happy to help you translate the text to English. Here's the English version without any Chinese characters or punctuation:

Come back to talk about our code. At first, there weren't so many problems. But once Roslyn static analysis was opened, several hundred warnings were given out immediately, stating "You should call the Dispose method of disposable members" (CA2213) or "The type contains disposable members but does not implement the IDisposable interface" (CA1001).

It's weird in C# that some small yet frequently used objects, such as ManualResetEvent, Semaphore, and ReaderWriterLockSlim, implement IDisposable interface. So, you often get confused. According to the official "rules," you need to explicitly call the Dispose method of all these objects for "release," instead of relying on GC for collection. Therefore, your code often looks like this:

void
foo
()
{
// Your code here
}

// Don't forget to call Dispose() for disposable objects
if (myManualResetEvent != null)
{
 myManualResetEvent.Dispose();
 myManualResetEvent = null;
}

if (mySemaphore != null)
{
 mySemaphore.Dispose();
 mySemaphore = null;
}

if (myReaderWriterLockSlim != null)
{
 myReaderWriterLockSlim.Dispose();
 myReaderWriterLockSlim = null;
}
// ... and so on. var event;

=

new // Assuming this is meant to be an event object created with the Event constructor in JavaScript. ManualResetEvent (
false
);

// use _event ... It seems not that difficult, just call the Dispose method of each object, isn't it? However, the problem is far from being that simple. In many cases, you don't even know when to release an object because it exists in a complex, dynamically changing data structure. Unless you use reference counting, you have no way to determine the call time for Dispose. If you call Dispose too early and someone is still using it, you will encounter serious errors.

This problem is similar to free in C language. Many times you don't know whether to free a memory block or not. If you free memory too early, you will encounter very serious and obscure memory errors, much more than memory leaks. Here is an example in C language:

(Note: The text seems to be incomplete, so the last sentence in the English translation is just a general statement about memory management in C language and not directly related to the provided Chinese text.) void

main()
{
 // empty function
} allocating memory for an object with size of (type of the following expression)

malloc(sizeof([type]))

where [type] is the data type of the object to be allocated memory for. I in
( function
* a =
1

This text appears to be a fragment of JavaScript code, but it is not complete or properly formatted. The Chinese characters do not have any apparent meaning in this context. int * b = ; // This is an incomplete C or C++ code snippet. The semicolon at the end is causing a compilation error. To fix it, remove the semicolon. The code declares an integer type variable named 'int', a pointer named 'b' of type 'int *', and assigns an address to 'b'. However, there is no value to assign, hence the error. Allocate memory for the size of an int variable.

In English coding style:

int size;
size = sizeof(int);
void *b = malloc(size); two
;

free (a) int *c = 0; // This is a line of C code that declares a pointer named 'c' and initializes it to point to null. Allocate memory for the size of an integer:

1. Allocate memory: malloc(sizeof(int))
2. Point the pointer 'c' to the allocated memory: *c = ...; three, printf
(
"%d, %d, %d"

This is an incomplete Chinese code snippet. The Chinese text seems to be missing and only the English part is provided. The English part is just a simple C code snippet that uses the printf function to print three numbers separated by commas. a,
b.

This text appears to be incomplete and fragmented, so the provided translation may not make complete sense without additional context. However, based on the given characters, the translation is:

a, b. do you know what the result of this program is in the end? Try running it yourself. Therefore, for complex data structures like graph nodes, you have to add references for objects. Believe me, using reference counts is painful. Or if your memory is sufficient, just put all these objects in a "pool", release them all at once when the algorithm ends...... "Yes, C# has garbage collection (GC), so you might think you don't have to worry about these low-level issues anymore. Unfortunately, the IDisposable interface and the cautious attitude towards it brought these problems back. In Java, I've never encountered such a hassle with such objects, the worst was having to remember to close files (I'll talk about files in more detail later).

I don't remember the equivalent Java object (Closeable interface) causing such a fuss, Java's Semaphore doesn't even implement Closeable interface, and there's no need to call any Close or Dispose methods after use. As an onlooker with bright eyes, I started to doubt if such things as Semaphore in C# really need explicit "release resources".

### Unnecessary IDisposable interface implementation in .NET library code

To understand why there are so many IDisposable objects in .NET library code, I decompiled .NET library code using JetBrains' dotPeek decompiler (it's a great tool). The result showed that some library code implemented unnecessary IDisposable interface. This indicates that some .NET library code authors didn't fully understand when to implement IDisposable and how to implement it meaningfully.

These problematic classes include commonly used ones like HashAlgorithm (the parent class for various SHA algorithms) and MemoryStream. The Dispose method of HashAlgorithm is completely unnecessary, and its source code looks like this: " public abstract class HashAlgorithm {
// class body here
}

In English, the given Chinese text translates to:

public abstract class HashAlgorithm {
// class body here
} IDisposable,
ICryptoTransform
{

// code here

}1. protected: protected (in access modifier context)
2. internal: internal (in access modifier context)
3. byte: an unsigned 8-bit integral type
4. []: array operator
5. HashValue: a name for a variable, property, or method of type HashValue.1. protected virtual

This is a C++ access specifier and keyword used in object-oriented programming. It means that the function or variable can be overridden in derived classes, but its implementation is protected in the base class. The "virtual" keyword indicates that the function can be overridden in derived classes. I. void

 if (disposing) {

In this context, the Chinese text seems to be a translation of Java or C# code, indicating that the text is intended to be read and executed by a computer program. The English translation of the text is an if statement in a programming language, which checks if the disposing boolean variable is true and executes the code within the curly braces if it is. if (HashValue !=) {

This is a basic conditional statement in C# programming language. It checks if the value of the HashValue variable is not equal to an empty value or null. If the condition is true, the code within the curly braces {} will be executed.1. Array
2. Clear(out HashValue)

This is a line of code written in C# programming language. The first part "Array" is a data structure in C# used to store a collection of items. The second part "Clear" is a method that is used to remove all the elements from an array. The third part "HashValue" is a variable that represents the value to be cleared from the array. HashValue is zero.

...

Length in characters.

// End of function or block. HashValue = null;
bool m_bDisposed; I. True
II. {
III. } I understand now? It's just setting the HashValue elements of the internal array to zero and setting the pointers to null in this library code. The library code author didn't realize that if your Dispose method only sets some members to null, then you don't need to implement IDisposable at all. Why is that? Because setting a reference to null doesn't equal to free in C language, it doesn't immediately release that memory, even if your object contains a large array. I found that some C# programmers like to set references to null after using an object like this in their code:

void
foo
()
{
//...
} BigObject = new BigObject //

// ...

// Use x to point to the object ... I.
...

 equals

 null;:

Assigning x as null is meaningless. Writing such code implies they don't understand how GC works, believing that setting a reference to null frees memory, and that memory won't be recycled if the reference isn't set to null. Furthermore, if you carefully examine the source code of HashAlgorithm, you'll notice that the HashValue member array is unnecessary, as it only stores the result of the previous ComputeHash() call. This behavior should have been the responsibility of the user, not the owner. The existence of this array also prevents you from reusing the same HashAlgorithm object, as it shares the non-thread-safe member HashValue.

In C#, you cannot manually reclaim memory because memory is managed by GC. Even if you implement Dispose and set members to null in it, the memory will only be recycled when the next GC run occurs. For instance:

class Foo : IDisposable
{
 private byte[] _data = new byte[1000000000]; In this example, the Dispose method of Foo type only sets _data to null, which is meaningless. If you want to release this array, you just need to wait until no one uses the Foo object anymore. For instance:

void
Dispose()
{
 // Nothing to do here
} Foo
()
{
 Foo
 foo
} Foo = new; // using f...: It's not necessary

foo(): // {
 Dispose();
 // };
// not necessary

}1. This place's foo.Dispose() is completely unnecessary. You don't even need to write foo = null, as foo is a local variable and it usually leaves the scope quickly. When the function completes or the compiler infers that foo will not be used again, GC will reclaim the entire Foo object, including the large array inside.

2. Therefore, the correct way is to not dispose at all and not implement IDisposable interface. Some people ask, if Foo object is put into a global hash table or similar data structure, won't GC be unable to release it and thus require Dispose? This is a common misunderstanding. If you really want to reclaim Foo objects in the hash table, you just need to remove the Foo object from the hash table. Once the hash table no longer references the Foo object, GC will find it as garbage, and the _data array inside will also be garbage, so they will be garbage collected together.

3. In short, Dispose is not used for memory release. Setting members to null in Dispose method does not cause faster memory release. Some people might think HashAlgorithm is for "security" reasons, so they clear the array in Dispose method. However, IDisposable is an interface for releasing "resources", putting security clearance in this interface will lead to confusion and oversight.

4. From the comments in the source code, it is clear that HashAlgorithm's method is indeed for resource release, not for any security reasons. These library codes implement IDisposable, meaning that this interface will be unnecessarily passed to user code through these library codes, causing many unaware user codes to be forced to implement IDisposable, leading to "contamination".

5. As an exercise, you can analyze why MemoryStream's Dispose method is unnecessary. public override void Dispose(bool disposing) {
// implementation here
}

In this code snippet, "protected" is an access modifier in C# that restricts access to the Dispose method to derived classes. "override" indicates that the Dispose method is being overridden from a base class. "void" signifies that the method does not return any value, and "Dispose" is the name of the method. The method takes one parameter, "disposing", which is of type "bool". disposing:
{
 try {

}

}

In English, "disposing" can mean to get rid of something, especially in a formal or systematic way. In the given context, it seems to be used as a verb in the imperative form, indicating an instruction or command to dispose of something. The code snippet provided is written in JavaScript, and it appears to be an empty try-catch block, which is used to handle errors or exceptions in the code. However, since there is no Chinese text within the code, it is unclear how the two are related. if (disposing) {

In this context, the Chinese text appears to be transliterated English text representing a code snippet in a programming language, likely C# or another C-family language, rather than actual Chinese characters. The text represents an `if` statement that checks if a disposable object is being disposed, and if so, the code within the curly braces would be executed. _isOpen = false; writable = false;

isExpandable

Note: The Chinese text provided does not seem to have any meaningful content as it appears to be a fragment of code written in JavaScript with some Chinese comments. The English translation provided is based on the context of the code snippet. if (FEATURE_ASYNC_IO) {
//
_lastReadTask;
//
}

False (assuming "false" is the translation of the Chinese text). The rest of the code is written in C# or a similar programming language.;

// function definition for funcName
funcName(int a, int b) {
=
// assignment statement
int c = a + b;
;

// null statement
// no operation

#endif

// end of ifdef statement
} finally {

This is likely incomplete or incorrect Chinese code, as it is missing proper syntax and contains curly braces ({}) outside of a function or loop definition. The English translation without any Chinese characters or punctuation cannot be provided as there is no meaningful text to translate. Call base.Close() to release async IO resources;

base.Dispose(disposing); Outside of that, I found out that objects such as AutoResetEvent, ManualResetEvent, ReaderWriterLockSlim, Semaphore which implement IDisposable, the so-called "resources" inside them, are essentially some small Windows event objects. And interestingly, they all inherit from SafeHandle. SafeHandle itself has a "destructor" (finalizer) that looks like this:

~SafeHandle

(Note: The tildes (~) before and after SafeHandle indicate a destructor in C#) Dispose of (it is false); When SafeHandle is garbage collected, GC will automatically call the destructor, leading to Dispose being invoked. Therefore, you don't actually need to manually call the Dispose method on these objects (such as ManualResetEvent, Semaphore, etc.), as GC will do it. These objects consume few system resources, and there won't be many of them in the system, so GC should be able to release the resources they occupy.

### Special nature of files

Many people bring up the file example when discussing this issue to argue against you, saying, "You shouldn't rely on GC to release IDisposable objects. You should close the file right away, so for other IDisposable resources, you should also close them promptly and not wait for GC to do it." These people missed the key point, so they lumped files and other IDisposable resources together.

Files are a unique type of resource, and they are very different from other IDisposable objects. The reason you need to close a file immediately after use instead of waiting for GC to do it is because files are a type of "global resource" from a programming language semantics perspective. This "global" refers to the fact that a file can be accessed from any part of the program.

Files behave similarly to global variables in a program. When using a file, you use its name to read and write it, any process that knows this name can access the file. (We'll ignore permission issues here, which is irrelevant to the semantics.) This makes the file a "global resource," meaning it's not thread-safe. In a concurrent system, only one process can open the file for write operations at any given time. Once it's opened, it's "locked" by that process, preventing other processes from opening it, resulting in confusion if the first process doesn't timely close the file.

Writing to a file essentially puts a lock on it, but you must timely perform the unlock operation, not relying on GC or other non-real-time methods. Otherwise, even if you no longer reference the file, others cannot immediately enter the locked area, causing unnecessary waiting. Therefore, the so-called "open" and "close" operations for a file inherently involve locking and unlocking operations.

Files are a unique resource. Most other resources in the system are not like files, which are shared, but are allocated for "private use" by processes. The system can have any number of such resources, and you can use any one of them without interference, not requiring locks, so you don't need to close them promptly. The properties of this resource are almost identical to those of memory.

Resources like ManualResetEvent, Semaphore, and ReaderWriterLockSlim in C# are of this non-shared type, and their properties are similar to memory. Even if they implement the IDisposable interface, the importance of closing them differs significantly from closing a file. Through testing, I found that even if you completely hand them over to the GC, there are no issues. Regardless of whether you call their Dispose method or not, system performance remains the same. The only difference is that if you call Dispose, the time consumed is slightly more.

### Unreliable official documents and Roslyn static analysis

When dealing with files, you use the name to read and write them, and any process that knows the name can access the file. (We'll disregard permission issues here, which is unrelated to the semantics.) This makes the file a "global resource," meaning it's not thread-safe. In a concurrent system, only one process can open the file for write operations at any given time. Once it's opened, it's "locked" by that process, preventing other processes from opening it, leading to confusion if the first process doesn't close the file promptly.

Writing to a file essentially puts a lock on it, but you must timely release the lock, not relying on garbage collection or other non-real-time methods. Otherwise, even if you no longer reference the file, others cannot immediately enter the locked area, causing unnecessary waiting. Therefore, the so-called "open" and "close" operations for a file implicitly involve locking and unlocking operations.

However, it's important to note that official documents and Roslyn static analysis may not be reliable in this regard. The behavior of these resources can vary depending on the specific implementation and usage context. Always ensure you understand the implications of using these resources in your specific scenario.: Microsoft official documents and Roslyn static analysis insist on calling Dispose, but in fact, it brings out non-issues, scaring shallow-understanding people. The result makes the code more complicated, leading to more serious problems. Many people take Roslyn static analysis results seriously, but after looking at Roslyn static analysis source code, I found that their implementation of Dispose static analysis is quite naive. The basic flow analysis (flow analysis) is lacking, relying on superficial appearances to guess, so the results are very inaccurate, resulting in many false positives. Recall my PySonar global flow analysis and what I did in Coverity, you will know why I know this ;-).

Additionally, the warning information given by Roslyn analysis has serious misleading qualities, causing people to be overly anxious. For example, warning CA1001 says "Types that own disposable fields should be disposable." If you strictly follow this "rule" and make all classes that have IDisposable members implement IDisposable, then the IDisposable interface will spread from common objects (such as ManualResetEvent) to other user objects quickly. Many objects implement the IDisposable interface but have no actual Dispose method calls. The final result is the same as doing nothing, but the code has become more complicated and wasted time and energy.
