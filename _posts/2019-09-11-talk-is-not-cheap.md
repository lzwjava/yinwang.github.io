title: "Talk is Not Cheap"
---

I've noticed that many IT professionals have learned a saying, no matter what opinion you express, they will respond with a teacher-like tone, saying, "Talk is cheap. Show me the code!" or "Show me what you've done!"

This expression holds two possible meanings:

1. Words are meaningless, prove it through action.: You have already achieved important results to be qualified to speak.

"Talk is cheap. Show me the code." This phrase is from Linus Torvalds in a post on the linux-kernel mailing list. If you have read my analysis of microkernels and threads, you might understand why Jamie Lokier's words actually make sense. If we keep an open mind, further discussion might bring breakthrough improvements to the Linux kernel, but this possibility was cut short by Linus's "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."

Linus may have been impatient at the time, you know this guy's character.... I believe he doesn't always say things this way, but because Linus's image is so grand, this phrase was recorded and used as a repeated tool to suppress speech. Regardless of what you express, they all have a universal catchphrase: "Talk is cheap. Show me the code."

"Work hard, speak with code, ignore ideas" is a common mistake among programmers. A person's thoughts do not necessarily need code to prove them, and many ideas cannot be simply expressed with code, only the human brain can clarify them. Thoughts are primary, code is just a way to implement thoughts. We first need thoughts (algorithms) to possibly have code. Some people "show me the code" without thinking or discussing, yet ignore the importance of thinking and discussing. If you don't have good ideas, what's the point of producing a heap of code? It's just digging deep into unnecessary details, hiding the essence.

Code cannot replace the exchange and discussion of ideas. Code cannot clearly express a person's thoughts, nor can it show a person's depth of thinking. Any programmer can write complex and verbose code, do you have the time to look at it? Even if the code is written by a high-level programmer, you won't understand their thoughts if you're not familiar with their coding style. The actual code is often filled with complexity due to programming languages, hardware, systems, and historical legacy issues. If every idea had to be "show me the code" to be considered, efficiency would be too low. I discuss code with my colleagues, usually I ask them to draw a diagram on the whiteboard first and explain their algorithm in simple terms before diving into the code. A few sentences can often clarify the whole concept, and I can visualize how it works in my head without even looking at the code. I never say "show me the code!" as ideas should be discussed before implementation, and unfeasible ideas should be abandoned in the incubation stage, while feasible ones should be explored in various directions.... These should all be clarified before implementing the code, saving us a great deal of time and energy.

This is the value of Talk.

Moreover, code and accomplishments should not be the conditions for expressing opinions. As long as a person's perspective is grounded, it is valuable. They don't need to have any major achievements to express their views. I discussed this in a previous article. Suppressing people's speech with code and so-called "accomplishments" is irrational, and code and accomplishments are actually poor indicators of whether a person's perspective is valuable.

Many people have had similar experiences when interviewing programmers. They show you code that's already been written, which is useless for evaluating their skill level. The code can be verbose and unclear, so even if it's their own work, you may not want to spend time understanding it.

Code is dead, it is a solution to existing problems. What you want to know is how this person approaches new problems and how they go about solving them. Therefore, you must understand this person's thought process and see if they truly understand what they claim to be "proficient" in. A person's past accomplishments are often unreliable. Results can be fabricated or stolen. A person can claim others' accomplishments as their own. This is especially true for managerial positions. Such a person might be just barking orders, assigning different directions to various people, and then getting lucky with one. The leader then takes credit for the work, becoming the one everyone admires as a "technical genius."

Many professors operate in this manner. They recruit N PhD students, each given a separate project. It doesn't matter if it's possible or valuable; they tell them all that their project is excellent. As long as two or three PhD students produce something, they can publish papers and get promoted. Students assigned to unproductive directions are ignored.

People with discernment engage them in conversation and discover that these individuals are half-knowledgeable yet still arrogant. This has been my experience multiple times. No matter what code projects or books a person claims to have worked on, awards they've received, their true abilities are revealed during face-to-face conversations. Code and books can be copied, accomplishments can be stolen, and you might even win a Nobel Prize this way, but you can't steal a conversation. A conversation reveals whether a person has genuine insight.

A small anecdote. At a previous company I worked for, they once hired a VP whose GitHub had over a million lines of code and tens of thousands of "stars," making them quite renowned in their field. Was this an accomplishment? However, once they joined the company, they started barking orders, making it impossible for everyone to work. They also brought in many of their cronies, who were a group of people who only knew how to blow their own horns and suppressed others, wasting vast amounts of human and material resources. I felt the company was on the verge of collapse, and finally, the founder woke up and spent great effort to get rid of these people.

Therefore, a person may have as many accomplishments as they want, but they might be useless. I don't exclude the possibility that they are genuine, but you must learn how to discern this, rather than just relying on these surface standards. I generally observe people's abilities by listening to their conversations, preferably face-to-face. I don't blindly believe in their supposed "achievements," I don't look at their code. Those who have true insights can freely express their thoughts and opinions without the need for time to memorize and calculate. I can easily tell if someone is telling the truth because truthful people don't need time to "calculate" what to say, they don't need to act.

Unfortunately, "Talk is cheap" has become a tool for suppressing speech for many people. It misleads many, preventing them from correctly evaluating a technical person's abilities and making serious hiring mistakes. Hiring the wrong person can destroy an entire company.

Those silenced by "Talk is cheap" are afraid to express their opinions and instead try to "do" something to impress others. But why should they be judged like that? What have they accomplished? Once you've actually done something to show them, they'll say your work is not good, it's not as good as xx's. I remember what I used to do was much better than yours... Other people are also vague, lacking the ability to discern.

People influenced by "show me the code" may make others look at their code without explaining their thoughts. In our work, we may have encountered someone who refuses to explain their thoughts and says, "You'll understand if you look at the code." This is disrespectful behavior. No one should be forced to read another person's code, the person writing the code has a duty to clearly explain the thoughts behind it.

Due to my expertise in certain areas, I have been contacted by people many times via email: "I made this thing, I want to know what you think of it." They don't even mention their basic ideas, let alone a self-introduction, and then come a GitHub code link or a large code segment pasted into the email. I don't look at such code. I may not even reply to the email because it shows a lack of basic politeness and respect for others' time. I. Code is not an effective communication tool, and it should not be used to determine whether someone has the right to speak. "Talk is cheap" is just a means of silencing people. Those who say "Talk is cheap" to others are the ones who talk the most.

II. People should be able to express themselves freely and equally, not subjected to unnecessary dogmas. Whenever someone points out the crux of a problem that has puzzled me for a long time, I will remember that person clearly. I will respect him, and give him a response when appropriate. Even if he does not give me new ideas, if he points out something I have pondered over for a long time but could not clarify, or offers a different perspective, I will remember him. These people who guide me in the right direction do not need me to look at their code, I do not judge their worth based on the final "results." Ideas and opinions are more valuable than code in my opinion.

III. "Talk is not cheap," it can be of great value. There is a Chinese proverb, "listening to one's speech is worth more than ten years of reading," which means the same thing. Of course, we should still avoid meaningless dialogue, but we should not indiscriminately say "Talk is cheap."

IV. However, I have found that not everyone is like me. Some people, when you point out the key issues or directions to them, they later claim it was their own idea, and even say that your words have no value, they only look at results.... When encountering such situations, you will know that you have encountered the wrong person. You do not need to prove anything to him, and should not give him any valuable information.

V. Many people are misled by "results" or code, and overlook those who can see through problems and point out the correct direction with simple words. I hope this article will correct the thinking of many industry personnel. Speech is not inexpensive. Speech can be potent.
