I'm an language expert who has implemented most language features. I don't believe any language is new. Any "new language" for me is just a collection of existing language features (or flaws). So I usually don't comment on other people's languages, not even bothering to look, unless it has a long history (like C or C++) or it has caused me trouble in my work (like Go and JavaScript). That's why people asked me about Rust, I usually don't reply or just ignore it.

However, I'm a little bored now, so I thought since someone is so enthusiastic about this new language, I might as well join in the fun and share some thoughts on certain common design approaches. So this article is not only about Rust's design, but about certain language features.

Since I'm hard to keep to myself, I'm only publishing the beginning of this article now and will update it as I write. So you should understand that this is just a beginning, I will update this article according to my own pace. You can come back and check for new content after some time. If you have any particularly confusing questions, you can ask and I will compile and publish my views on them later.

### Variable declaration syntax

Rust's variable declaration syntax is a bit different from other languages. Instead of using the "var" or "let" keyword followed by a variable name and an equals sign, Rust uses the equals sign followed by the variable name and the type. For example:

```rust
let x: i32 = 5;
```

This declares a variable named "x" of type "i32" and initializes it to the value 5. The reason for this syntax is to make it clear that the variable is being declared and initialized at the same time. In other languages, the variable might be declared without initialization, and then later assigned a value. This can lead to errors if the variable is used before it is assigned a value.

Rust's syntax also allows for multiple variable declarations in one line, with each variable having its own type:

```rust
let (x, y) = (1, 2);
```

This declares and initializes two variables, "x" and "y", with types inferred from the initial values.

Overall, Rust's variable declaration syntax is a way to make it clear that a variable is being declared and initialized at the same time, which can help prevent certain types of errors. It's a design choice that has its pros and cons, and it's important to understand how it works in order to effectively use Rust. Rust's variable declaration is similar to Scala and Swift. You use

let
x
=
8

In English: Rust's variable declaration is like Scala and Swift. You use 'let' 'x' = 8. This way to declare a new variable. In most cases, Rust can infer the variable type, so you don't necessarily need to specify it. If you really want to indicate the variable type, write it as:

let x: i32 In my opinion, this syntax is ugly. The meaning originally was to bind variable x to value 8, but x and 8 are separated by "i32", making it look like 8 is being assigned to i32....

Variables have a default value which is immutable, meaning they cannot be reassigned. You need to use a special construction for that. let mut x = 8; I. Declare a mutable variable. This is similar to Swift/Scala's let and var, but the form is slightly different.

II. Rust's variable definition has a quirky aspect compared to other languages. It allows you to "re-bind" the same name in the same scope, and even bind it to another type:

let mut

(Note: In the given text, 'mut' is a keyword in Rust that denotes a mutable variable.) i32 = 1; // This is a comment in C or C++ programming language. The Chinese text does not provide any meaningful information for translation. x is equal to 7;
let

Here is the English translation of the given Chinese text without any Chinese characters or punctuation:

x is equal to 7
let two different variables named x

let x1;
let x2; y is an uninitialized variable in Chinese characters. In the given context, it seems like a mistake or an incomplete code snippet. Without additional context, it's impossible to provide a meaningful English translation. The semicolon at the end of the line is a common punctuation mark used in programming languages to denote the end of a statement. However, in this case, it's not followed by a statement, so it's also unclear what it represents. The numbers 4 and 30 are likely constants or variables with unknown meanings in this context. I can also be bound to text!
// 30 lines of code ...

Here is the English translation:

I can also be bound to text!
// Thirty lines of code ... println!("y is {}", y);

// Definition of y in the second let y place. In the initial design of Yin language, I also allowed such repeated bindings. The first y and the second y were two different variables, they just happened to have the same name. You could even have two x's on the same line, but they were actually different variables! Isn't this a cool, flexible design that no other language has? However, I later found that although it was not difficult to implement, it did not bring any significant convenience, and instead might lead to program confusion. Giving two different variables the same name in the same scope, what's the point? It's just asking for trouble.

For instance, in the example above, where is the reference to variable y coming from? You need to perform "data flow analysis" in your mind to find its definition location. From the above, we see let y = 4, but this may not be the correct definition, as y can be re-bound, so we need to keep looking. Thirty lines of code later, we see the second binding of y, but we still cannot be sure. Continuing to scan down, thirty lines of code later we find the reference to y, and we haven't seen any other bindings to y, so we can be sure that the second let is the definition of y, it is a string.

Isn't this a hassle? Worse still, this manual scanning is not a one-time task, every time you encounter this variable, you have to wonder what it is, as it can be re-bound, you have to re-determine its definition. If the language does not allow re-binding the same name in the same scope, you wouldn't have to worry about this issue at all. You just need to find the unique let y = ... in the scope, that's its definition.

Perhaps you will say, only when someone abuses this feature will there be problems. However, language design issues often lie in the fact that once you allow some strange usage, someone will surely find a way to misuse it. Since you cannot be sure if someone will do that, you have to stay alert all the time, instead of relaxing.

### Type Inference

In the initial design of the Yin language, I also allowed such repeated bindings. The first y and the second y were two different variables, they just happened to have the same name. You could even have two x's on the same line, but they were actually different variables! Isn't this a cool, flexible design that no other language has? However, I later found that although it was not difficult to implement, it did not bring any significant convenience, and instead might lead to program confusion. Giving two different variables the same name in the same scope, what's the point? It's just asking for trouble.

However, there is a technique called "type inference" that can help alleviate this issue. With type inference, the compiler can automatically infer the type of a variable based on its usage, so even if two variables have the same name, the compiler can distinguish them based on their types. For example, if we have two variables named x, one is a number and the other is a string, the compiler can easily tell them apart. This way, we don't need to worry about variable naming collisions and can write more concise and readable code.

Therefore, I decided to add type inference to the Yin language, and it greatly improved the language's design. This feature not only helps prevent variable naming collisions but also makes the code more concise and easier to read. It's a win-win situation!

So, even though allowing variable name repetition might seem like a cool and flexible design, it can lead to confusion and unnecessary complexity. Type inference is a much better solution that can help us write clearer, more concise code while still maintaining the flexibility of variable binding. Outside of what many people misunderstand is type inference. In Rust and C# among other languages, you don't need to write:

int x = 8;

as in Java. This way of explicitly stating variable types allows the compiler to infer them instead. For instance, you write:

let
x
=
[
// Type inference in action: the type of 'x' is inferred to be 'number[]' or 'string[]' based on the type of elements in the array literal
[1, 2, 3]
// or
["apple", "banana", "orange"]
];

The compiler's type inference can determine the type of x as i32 without you having to write "i32" there. This seems convenient. However, after looking at many C# codes, you find that this seemingly convenient feature makes the program hard to read. When looking at C# codes, I often see a pile of variable definitions, each with a "var" before it. I cannot tell at a glance what they represent - integers, booleans, strings, or some user-defined classes?

var correct; var id = []; // empty array declaration in JavaScript. The Chinese text seems to be missing or incorrect.;

var slot;

// or

var slot = []; // assuming "..." represents an empty array initialization. var user; // declaration of a variable named "user" without initial value. I need to move the mouse over the variable to let Visual Studio show its derived type, but when I move the mouse away, I may forget what it is. I often have to repeat this process when looking at the same code. And if I'm not using Visual Studio, or looking at code on GitHub or during code review, I won't get this information. Many C# programmers, to avoid this problem, started using long variable names and putting the type name in the variable name, making it even more complex but not solving the issue. So this form of type inference, which seems advanced or convenient, is actually not as good as directly writing the variable type in the declaration, like in Java.

Although Rust seems to have more flexible design in variable declarations, I still think the rigid way of languages like C and Java is better. I recommend not using Rust variable's repeated binding, avoiding type inference, and being explicit about types to make it easier for readers. If you really care about code quality, you'll find that most of the time your code readers are yourself, as you need to frequently read and refactor your code. actions "return value"

Rust documentation describes it as a "mostly expression-based" language, and provides the following example:

let mut y = {
// some code here
}; let x = 5; empty array with a length of 6. Strangely, variable x will get an empty tuple, (). This approach is not correct, it was borrowed from languages like OCaml, but OCaml itself has issues. In OCaml, if you use print_string, you will get the following result:

print_string
--------------
"hello world!
\n"
;; Hello World!
- In this place, print\_string is an "action", which corresponds to a "statement" in procedural programming languages, such as C's printf. An action usually only has "side effects" but does not return a value. In OCaml, for the sake of "theoretical elegance", an action also returns a value, which is called (). In fact, () is equivalent to C's void. Although C has a void type, it does not allow you to declare a variable of void type. For instance, you write

Therefore, in OCaml, when you want to define a function that does not return any value, you can use the empty tuple () as its return type. int
main()
{
 void // declaration of a function with no name
{
// function body is empty in this case A program with this code cannot compile (give it a try?). It's surprising that the old C way of doing things is actually correct here. If you consider a type as a set (for example, int is the set of machine integers), then the set represented by void is an empty set, it doesn't contain any elements. Declaring a variable of void type is meaningless because it cannot have a value. If a function returns void, you cannot assign it to a variable.

However, in Rust, not only actions (like y = 6) return a value (()), you can even assign this value to a variable. This is incorrect behavior. The reason is that y = 6 is just an "action", it only puts 6 into variable y, this action has happened already, it shouldn't return a value, it shouldn't appear on the right side of let x = (y = 6);. Even if you forcefully associate the return value of y = 6 as (), this value is useless. Worse still, using an empty tuple to represent this value will cause more type confusion, because () itself has another, more meaningful meaning.

You should not be able to write let x = (y = 6); code. Only when you make mistakes or your logic is unclear will you treat y = 6 as a value. Rust allows you to assign this meaningless return value to a variable, and this error goes unnoticed, spreading to another place through the variable. Sometimes this error can propagate quite far, leading to problems (runtime errors or type checking errors), but when it occurs, it is not easy to find the origin of the error. This is a common issue in many languages, especially those like JavaScript or PHP. They propagate meaningless or forced results (such as undefined) everywhere, making errors hard to find and trace.

### return statement

Rust's designers seem to be strong advocates of "expressive programming," so in Rust, you don't need to write the "return" statement directly. For instance, in this example, you can write it like this:

fn add\_one {
5: return 1 + x;
}

Or, more idiomatically in Rust, you can use an expression as the function's return value:

fn add\_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
1 + x
}: function (x: i32) -> i32

This is a Haskell-like function definition in Chinese characters. The English translation is:

function: takes an i32 argument and returns an i32 value. blank line with an 'x' and a '+' symbol
1 In functional programming, return the last expression in a function without writing a return statement. This is a common feature of functional languages. However, I personally think it's better to write an explicit return statement, like this:

fn foo(x: [

// function body here

]) {
return // last expression in the function body
} i32
)
 ->
 i32
{

This text appears to be a snippet of code written in the C programming language. The Chinese characters do not have any meaning in this context, as they are likely placeholders or comments in the code. The English translation of the code is:

int i32;
)
 int i32;
{

This code declares an integer variable named "i32" twice. The first declaration is followed by an empty statement (represented by the parentheses), and the second declaration is followed by a block of code enclosed in curly braces. However, since there is no code within the block, it is essentially empty. return
x + 1; In programming, there's a common practice that can lead to issues, called "not being explicit", trying to let the compiler handle some problems on its own. The same issue arises here. If you implicitly return the last expression in a function, then every time you see this function, you have to figure out what the last expression is, which isn't always clear. For instance, consider the following code:

fn
main
()
{
// Implicit return of the last expression in the function
[1, 2, 3].map(|x| x + 1)
} "Print the value of the variable enclosed in the curly braces and add one to the number 7."

println!({}); // Print the value of the variable
add_one(7); // Add one to the number 7. function add\_one(x: [array]) {

// Code for adding one to each element in the array goes here

}

// This is a function definition in Rust programming language. It is named 'add\_one' and takes an array as an argument. The argument is named 'x'. The function does not have any return type specified, so it is assumed to be void. The code block inside the function contains comments explaining that the code for adding one to each element in the array goes there. i32
(
->

i32
{

This text appears to be written in a programming language, likely Assembly or a low-level language, with some missing or incorrect characters. The translation would depend on the specific context and syntax of the language being used. However, based on the given text, it seems to declare an integer variable named "i32" and define a jump or branch instruction with the label "(" and the target label "->". The body of the instruction appears to be empty, as indicated by the curly braces with no content. if (x < 5)

This is an if statement in programming, which means "if the value of variable x is less than 5, then execute the code within the brackets." if (x < [

This is an incomplete fragment of code written in the C programming language. The English translation of the given Chinese text would be:

if (x < [

This line of code is checking if the value of variable 'x' is less than the value inside the brackets '['. If that condition is met, the code within the curly braces '{ ... }' following the 'if' statement will be executed. I do a lot of things... // This is a comment in Chinese code, likely indicating that the following code block contains instructions for doing many things. The English translation is provided as a rough approximation, as the exact meaning may depend on the specific context of the code. two
{
 else Do a lot of things...

x + // This line seems incomplete or irrelevant to the context of the Chinese text provided. if (condition) {
// code block 1
} else {
// code block 2
}

This is a basic conditional statement structure in programming, written in the C-family syntax. The text provided appears to represent this structure in a simplified form, with some parts missing, such as the opening curly brace for the if statement and the condition expression. Do a lot of things...

I'm unable to provide an exact translation without additional context as the given text appears to be incomplete and contains code-like symbols. The provided Chinese text seems to be a comment in a programming language, possibly indicating that the following code block does a lot of things. Due to nested if statements with multiple codes in each branch, and if statement being the last one, all three exits of the nested if have the last expression as the return value. If you have written "return", you can directly see how many "returns" there are, or use the editor to highlight it. However, without the "return" keyword now, you need to clarify the last if statement yourself, find the last expression in each branch. This is not always obvious, and you need to keep looking for it while reading the code. I recommend being explicit about return values by always writing "return" as in the second example. Rust's documentation states this is "poor style", but that's not true. There's an exception, which is when the function body consists of only one statement, in which case there's no ambiguity about which is the return expression.

This issue is similar to the problem of variable and type rebindings and type inference, which belongs to the category of "user experience design" issues. Regardless, the compiler can easily handle it, but the workload for human reading varies greatly for different styles of code. Often, the most efficient way is not the one that looks smartest, coolest, or requires the least typing, but the one that is most clear and saves the reader time. As people often say, reading code takes much more time than writing it, so we should pay more attention to making it easier to read rather than to write.

### Array Mutability

Rust's array mutability marker commits the same error as Swift. I have already explained Swift's issue in detail in a previous article, so I won't go into it here. In essence, the mutability that can be represented by a marker should either apply to the array pointer or to the array elements, and only one should be chosen. In Rust, you only have one place to put "mut" in, so either the array pointer and elements are both mutable, or they are both immutable. You cannot specify an immutable array pointer that points to a mutable array.

Compare the following two examples:

```rust
fn example1(&mut arr: &mut [i32]) {
    arr[0] = 42;
}

fn example2(mut arr: &mut [i32]) {
    arr[0] = 42;
}

fn example3(&mut arr: &mut [i32]) {
    arr = [1, 2, 3];
}

fn example4(mut arr: &mut [i32]) {
    arr = [1, 2, 3]; // Error: cannot assign to `arr`
}
```

In the first example, we have a mutable reference to the entire array. In the second example, we also have a mutable reference to the entire array, but we explicitly mark it with "mut". The third example demonstrates a mutable reference to a slice, which is a subreference of the original array. In the fourth example, we try to assign a new slice to the mutable reference, but Rust does not allow this because the reference itself is immutable.

To create a mutable reference to a slice, we need to use the "mut" keyword when defining the function signature, as shown in the first and second examples. This ensures that the function can modify the array, and the compiler understands that the function intends to modify the array.

When working with arrays in Rust, it's essential to be aware of their mutability and use the correct mutability marker to avoid unexpected behavior. main() {
let {
// code here
}
}m =
[1, 2, ] Three
// pointer and element are both immutable

m [
[0] "Error occurred" or "An error has occurred"

This text appears to be a comment in a programming code, likely written in the C or C++ programming language. The Chinese characters translate to the English phrase "出错" which means "error" or "mistake". The semicolon and slashes are used for different purposes in programming and do not have any meaning in this context when translated to English.m =
[4, 5] six
// error occurred

}

fn main function {
let mut [

This text appears to be written in Rust programming language. The Chinese characters are not present in the code. The text begins with the keyword "main" which signifies the starting point of a Rust program. The code block is defined by the curly braces {}. Inside the function, there is a let statement which declares a mutable variable named "[", but it is empty. The keyword "mut" indicates that the variable is mutable. However, since the variable is empty, it doesn't have any value assigned to it. Therefore, the English translation of the text is simply:

main function {
let mut []; // empty mutable slicem =
[1, 2, ] three
// pointer and element are mutable

int m[3][0]; 10
;

// No error

    

(Note: The Chinese text provided does not seem to contain any meaningful content as it consists of numbers and symbols only. The English translation is provided for completeness.)m =
[
4,
5, six
// no error

### Memory Management

Note: The Chinese text provided seems to be incomplete and contains invalid characters. The given English translation is based on the context of the code snippet, assuming it is related to memory management in a programming context. I. Rust is famously known for its advanced memory management mechanism, which allegedly doesn't require garbage collection (GC) or reference counting (RC) to "statically" manage memory allocation and deallocation. However, upon closer examination, this is likely an unrealistic fantasy (or advertising). Memory allocation and deallocation (if done in a timely manner), by nature, is a dynamic process and cannot be achieved through static analysis. Can one really determine memory reclamation time statically through some special constructs, pointers, and passing methods?

II. I used to have a similar dream. I once presented several ways to my professors to manage memory without GC and RC, but each time I was defeated by their counterexamples, making it hard for me to believe that anyone could come up with a better solution than GC and RC.

III. Rust's fancy move semantics, borrowing, lifetimes, and such concepts make the language complex and hard to grasp. I don't believe these concepts can fundamentally solve memory management issues. Many people enthusiastically promote these concepts in their blogs, making it seem like they're experts, but nobody explains clearly why these things can solve the problem from the root or how they can be applied to more complex code. I think these things have a "new emperor's clothes" feel to them.

IV. Even Rust's own documentation admits that you might need to "fight with the borrow checker." To get past these checks, you must write code in strange ways. As complexity increases, the required writing style becomes even more peculiar. If you use lifetimes, a simple code snippet will look like this. I find it quite annoying; my eyes can't parse this code anymore.

fn

(Note: The text seems incomplete, as it ends with "fn" without any context.) Foo
'a,
'b
>
(x: [

This text appears to contain some invalid or incomplete Chinese characters, as well as English text mixed in. Without proper context or complete information, it is difficult to provide an accurate translation. However, based on the English text present, it seems to be defining a variable named "foo" and an array named "[x]" with an element labeled "a" and another labeled "b". The ">" symbol may represent array indexing or some other operation, but without more context it is unclear. a str, y :

This text appears to be a mix of English and Chinese characters. The English part is "a str, y :" which seems to be a programming or coding notation, possibly meaning "a string, y as a variable name and colon for assignment or definition purpose. However, without additional context, it's hard to be certain. The Chinese characters "a" and "str" do not have a clear meaning in this context. bstr to string conversion arrow & 'a

This text appears to be a fragment of code written in the Pascal programming language. The Chinese characters do not have any meaning in this context, as they are likely placeholders or have been accidentally included in the code snippet. The English text, "bstr to string conversion arrow & 'a," can be translated to "convert bstr to string using the arrow operator & 'a." However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the exact meaning of this code snippet. I last checked Rust documentation and didn't find the concept of lifetime. The documentation's explanation was very vague, and even after careful consideration, I didn't understand what they were talking about, let alone believing this method actually works. Frankly, I don't even want to understand what 'a and 'b are inside these angle brackets unless you first prove that these things can truly solve memory management issues. In fact, I feel that this lifetime is similar to some labels generated during static analysis, since static analysis cannot solve memory management problems. I guess this lifetime will cause trouble in cases with recursive functions.

Initially, when I first learned Rust, it claimed that it could solve memory management problems using only move semantics and a few different pointers. However, once these different pointers were introduced, it became too complex and more troublesome than C, and obviously could not solve the problem. Lifetime probably came later when they realized there were new problems that couldn't be solved, but I don't know if they considered all the cases this time. I. Rust's designers were inspired by Logic, specifically Linear Logic, which seemed cool, to miraculously solve memory and resource recovery issues. However, after researching Linear Logic for some time, I found that it hadn't solved any problems on its own, only imposing unnecessary constraints on object references, making reference counts a fixed value (1). Memory management became easier, but this led to many programs that couldn't be expressed.

At first, it seemed interesting and could potentially solve some small problems. However, when faced with larger practical issues, you found that increasingly complex concepts and bizarre writing styles were required to achieve the goal. And you would always discover that it couldn't solve certain problems in the future. Since this problem was likely unsolvable from the root, whenever you encountered something beyond current capabilities, you had to add new "workarounds" (patches). Patching up holes, falling apart. In the end, you found that besides garbage collection (GC) and reference counting (RC), there were no other better and simpler memory management methods.

Of course, my opinion may not be entirely accurate, but I'm too busy to ponder all these confusing concepts (especially lifetimes), let alone build large-scale system programs with them. The time spent understanding these concepts and making the program strange could have been used to write good manual memory management code in C. If you truly understand these things and find them useful, let me know! But you must explain the reasons, not just tell me "the emperor is wearing clothes" :P

II. I originally intended to write a more detailed evaluation, but I've lost interest at this point. One word: Rust is too complex compared to C language, and I find it hard to imagine using such a language to construct large-scale operating systems. Constructing system programs was the original intention of Rust. To be honest, constructing operating system-level programs with C is not particularly unpleasant. User-space programs, such as Java, C#, and Swift, can handle the task perfectly. So I believe the market for Rust is quite limited.... if you like these contents, please pay 5 dollars or 30 rmb, thank you!
